This paper discusses the influence of aerodynamic drag
torque on the dynamics of a satellite in a very low altitude
orbit.Design recommendations and tradeoffs are presented for
the use of aerodynamic drag in attitude control.The results have been applied on a ESA study satellite
required in an orbit with less than 250 km altitude. Simulations
and analytical results indicate that the satellite will
oscillate between two attitude equilibria. Performance of
a basic attitude control algorithm providing stable satellite

Orientation Estimation Using MARG Sensors<br></a>
Abstract: This paper presents an extended Kalman
filter for real-time estimation of rigid body orientation
using the newly developed MARG (Magnetic, Angular
Rate, and Gravity) sensors. Each MARG sensor
contains a three-axis magnetometer, a three-axis
angular rate sensor, and a three-axis accelerometer. The
filter represents rotations using quaternions rather than
Euler angles, which eliminates the long-standing
problem of singularities associated with attitude
estimation. A process model for rigid body angular
motions and angular rate measurements is defined. The
process model converts angular rates into quaternion
rates, which are integrated to obtain quaternions. The
Gauss-Newton iteration algorithm is utilized to find the
best quaternion that relates the measured accelerations
and earth magnetic field in the body coordinate frame
to calculated values in the earth coordinate frame. The
best quaternion is used as part of the measurements for
the Kalman filter. As a result of this approach, the
measurement equations of the Kalman filter become
linear, and the computational requirements are
significantly reduced, making it possible to estimate
orientation in real time.<br>

knowledge of sensor orientation. These facilities are
expensive and can be tedious to use. A method for

The QUEST algorithm, which works with vector
attitude observations, serves as a starting point because it is able to work with a poor (or no) first guess of the attitude. It is
able to do this because its nonlinear estimation problem can be solved exactly by solving an eigenvalue/eigenvector problem.
This paper's extended version of QUEST uses square-root information filtering techniques and linearization of the dynamics
to handle all of the non-QUEST parts of the estimation problem. The remaining QUEST-type part of the problem can be
solved by a technique that is an extension of the original QUEST algorithm's eigenvalue/eigenvector solution. The paper
shows that two previously-proposed iterative QUEST techniques are special cases of the present algorithm. It also
demonstrates the new algorithm's performance on an attitude determination problem that uses star-tracker and rate-gyro
measurements to estimate the attitude time history and the rate-gyro biases.<br>

Abstract
A batch filter has been designed to autonomously
estimate the orbit of a LEO spacecraft using data only
from a magnetometer and a sun sensor. The goal of
this study has been to prove the feasibility of a
proposed low-cost, moderate-accuracy autonomous
orbit determination system. The system uses a batch
filter to estimate the Keplerian orbital parameters, a
drag parameter, magnetometer biases, and corrections
to the Earth's magnetic field. It does this by
minimizing the square errors between measured and
estimated values of two quantities, the Earth's magnetic
field magnitude and the cosine of the angle between the
sun vector and the Earth's magnetic field vector, both
measured at the spacecraft. The proposed system is
observable, and reasonable accuracy is obtainable.
Given a magnetometer with a 10 nT 1-s accuracy and a
sun sensor with a 0.005 o 1-s accuracy, the system can
achieve 1-s position accuracies on the order of 500 m
for inclined LEO orbits.<br>

The objective of this paper is to give a design scheme
for attitude control algorithms of a generic spacecraft.
Along with the system model formulated in the Hamilton's canonical form the algorithm uses information
about a required potential energy and a dissipative
term. The control action is the sum of the gradient
of the potential energy and the dissipative force. It
is shown that this control law makes the system uniformly asymptotically stable to the desired reference
point. Three problems were addressed in the paper:

damping with the use of electromagnetic coils and a
slew maneuver with an additional objective ofavoiding

<p><a href="CommonAlgorithms/4406.pdf">Stabilization of Rotational Motion with Application

The objective of this paper is to develop a control scheme for stabilization of a hamiltonian system. The method generalizes the results
available in the literature on motion control in the Euclidean space to an arbitrary differential manifold equipped with a metric. This
modification is essencial for global stabilization of a rotary motion.
Along with a model of the system formulated in the Hamilton's canonical form the algorithm uses information about a required potential
energy and a dissipation term. The control action is the sum of the gradient of the potential energy and the dissipation force. It is shown that
this control law makes the system uniformly asymptotically stable to the desired reference point. The concept is very straightforward in the
Euclidean space, however a global rotation control can not be tackled. An additional modification is made to address a system which flow lies
on a Riemannian manifold. The Lyapunov stability theory is adapted and reformulated to fit to the new framework of Riemannian manifolds.
To illustrate the results a spacecraft attitude control problem is considered.<br>

given the geomagnetic field and the satellite angular velocity at each actuation instant. The proposed controller

This paper addresses the control of linear systems with input saturations. We seek a

outputs of interest. Two approaches are proposed based on: (1) ensuring that the
controller never saturates: the obtained controller is Linear Time Invariant (LTI),
(2) ensuring absolute stability against the saturations: the controller is then Linear
Time Varying (LTV). Existence conditions for these two control structures can be
cast as (convex) optimization problems over Linear Matrix Inequalities. At last, using
numerical experiments, we compare both approaches. In this numerical examples, the

Attitude control law design for spacecraft large angle maneuvers is investigated in this paper. The

function to be tracked is the quaternion attitude parameter. The designed control law turns out to be a
combination of attitude and attitude rate tracking command. The attitude-only output function, therefore, leads
to a stable closed-loop system following the given reference trajectory. The principal advantage of the
proposed method is that it is relatively easy to produce reference trajectories and associated controller. The
controller is also simplified with stable tracking performance.<br>

(Paulo Tabuada, Pedro Alves, Pedro Tavares, Pedro Lima
Setembro 1998, Instituto de Sistemas e Robotica)<br></a>
This class of LEO satellites (Low Earth Orbit)
may be controlled by strict interaction with the geomagnetic field. A magnetic
moment produced by coils placed on the satellite will produce a resultant torque by
interaction with the geomagnetic field, which may be used for attitude control
purposes. Nevertheless, this simple, low power consumption approach poses several
interesting control difficulties as the geomagnetic field viewed by a satellite, changes
along its orbit. Besides this time dependency, this problemís mathematical description
is highly non-linear, and new control strategies are needed to solve the attitude and
control demands of such a satellite.
Several control strategies were implemented and simulated in a realistic

FOR THE SCHOOL MICROSATELLITE<br></a>
Simple magneto-gravitational system (MGS) for the attitude control and stabilization of the
School Scientific-Research Micro-Satellite (SSRMS) [1] is described. Using the MGS for the
SSRMS is preferable due to several points. First, physical ideas lying in the base of this system
are very simple to explain for students. Second, active magnetic stabilization systems are very
effective and suitable for small satellites in comparison to active gas microengines because of
their ions and gas production around the satellite and as a consequence creation of some
interference to the scientific measurements. Third, the MGS can operate with use of power
supply during a short time. Some technological characteristics of the MGS are discussed:
angular range of the stabilization around the Earthís-directional axes, precision, electromagnetic
compatibility to other service and scientific systems of SSRMS, possible operation of such type
of systems together with TV and optical equipment. Some separate exploration was made for
the possibility of precise magnetic measurements on the micro-satellite, which is equipped with
such system. As a result some processing procedures are described.<br>

<p><a href="CommonDesign/smallsat.pdf">Autonomous Attitude Control System for the Orsted Satellite<br></a>
Attitude control for small satellites differ from traditional attitude control systems
by having simple hardware and inexpensive actuators imposed by cost constraints. Limited
ground contact, on the other hand, imposes requirements to autonomy of the attitude control.
These conflicting requirements are fulfilled through development of novel attitude and control
algorithms combined with an on-board supervisory control architecture.
Attitude estimation with an extended Kalman filter using sun sensor and magnetometer data
is introduced as a backup to a star camera estimate. This enables continued operation in case
of star camera or sun sensor failures. Three-axis attitude stabilization is provided with use of
a set of three perpendicular magnetorquers. The attitude control and estimation algorithms
are integrated into a supervisory control architecture that enables reconfiguration in real time,
based on mission phase and contingency operation requirements. This provides some level
of fault tolerance with graceful degradation in case of severe faults.
Results from simulations are presented to demonstrate projected performance capability.<br>

The problem of reorienting a spacecraft in to acquire a moving target is investigated. The
spacecraft is modeled as a rigid body with N axisymmetric wheels controlled by axial torques,
and the kinematics are represented by Modified Rodriques Parameters. The trajectory, denoted the
reference trajectory, is one generated by a virtual spacecraft that is identical to the actual spacecraft.
The open-loop reference attitude, angular velocity, and angular acceleration tracking commands
are constructed so that the solar panel vector is perpendicular to the sun vector during the tracking
maneuver. We develop a nonlinear feedback tracking control law, derived from Lyapunov stability
and control theory, to provide the control torques for target tracking. The controller makes the
body frame asymptotically track the reference motion when there are initial errors in the attitude
and angular velocity. A spacecraft model, based on the X-ray Timing Explorer spacecraft, is used
to demonstrate the effectiveness of the Lyapunov controller in tracking a given target.(Thesis submitted to the Faculty of the

analytic and numerical models in order to take
in account such effects. Numerical tests using

model for the linearized satellite dynamics
around the gravity gradient equilibrium
position under the effect of the aerodynamic

Spartnik is a micro-satellite under construction at San JosÈ State University. In order to
control the satellite and ensure payloads and antenna are oriented properly a passive attitude
control system has been developed. Like some other micro-satellites, Spartnik will combine spin
stabilization with magnetic stabilization. Thus, Spartnik will "spin" due to solar radiation pressure
and perform a controlled "tumble" due to the permanent magnets aligning with the magnetic field of
the Earth. Concerns have been raised about the gyroscopic effect due to the spin of the satellite. A
program has been developed that numerically integrates Euler's form of the equations of motion in
order to explore the gyroscopic effect and finalize the hardware design of Spartnik. Simulations
have been performed that reveal the dynamic response of Spartnik under a number of conditions.

SNAP-1 Nanosatellite<br></a>SNAP-1 is the first 3-axis stabilised nanosatellite in orbit. The satellite is stabilised by a single Y-momentum
wheel and 3-axis magnetorquer rods, used for nutation damping and wheel momentum management.
The primary attitude sensor used for attitude and rate estimation, is a miniature 3-axis magnetometer. This paper
will show the attitude performance results during pointing of the CMOS cameras. One of the challenges was how
to handle a large residual magnetic moment disturbance on the satellite. This disturbance was caused by an
unforseen permanent magnetisation dipole from the thruster solenoids, which could not be fully cancelled by the
magnetorquer rods. To enable the onboard attitude and rate Kalman filter to give accurate state estimates, the
magnetic disturbance was first characterised and then partially compensated for, using the magnetorquer rods.
The paper will explain how this problem was solved, before the Y-momentum wheel could be utilised to stabilise
and point the imaging payload. The attitude disturbances during firings of the butane gas thruster will also be
presented and characterised. The effect of these firings on the orbit will be shown as measured by the GPS
receiver on SNAP-1. The lessons learned from the AODCS design of a SSTL nanosatellite are summarised.

AttSim specifically allows the user to develop software modules that can be used as flight code, and to ver-ify
control logic, controller gains, and other mission-critical elements. The code can be developed in a
flight-like environment, allowing quick conversion to actual flight code for a target processor. In addition,
AttSim can be used as a systems engineering tool to ensure correct torquer, wheel, and thruster sizing and
sensor performance. AttSim allows derivation of subsystem requirements to meet attitude accuracy (point-ing

challenge is the fact that the mechanical torque can

gives an excellent frame for investigations provided

power e$ciency is attractive on small, inexpensive satellites. This principle is however inherently nonlinear, and di$cult to use since
the control torque can only be generated perpendicular to the geomagnetic "eld vector. This paper shows that three-axis control can
be achieved with magnetorquers as sole actuators in a low Earth near polar orbit. It considers the problem from a time-varying,

also since this particular wheel is an experiment on TiungSAT-1, there may arise a need
to stop it spinning.
This simulation-based study investigates the feasibility and performance of a
proposed strategy for starting up the wheel and stopping it in an emergency. It basically
involves tricking the wheel controller to start-up or slow down the wheel through
instructing initial pitch demands. The momentum wheel control system is a proportional

Christopher D. Hall 2,Aerospace and Ocean Engineering,Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University,Blacksburg, Virginia<br></a>
The stability of motion of attitude maneuvers of a torque-free rigid gyrostat with a discrete damper
is investigated. The equations of motion are presented and non-dimensionalized, then rewritten as
a singularly perturbed, noncanonical, Hamiltonian system. Conditions for equilibrium motions and
for their stability are developed. Bifurcation diagrams are used to illustrate the stable and unstable
branches of steady spins, and these bifurcation diagrams are interpreted in the slow state space
of the rotor momenta and the unperturbed system Hamiltonian. Numerical integration is used to
compute representative momentum transfer trajectories, which are also interpreted as projections
onto the slowstate space. We are especially interested in identifying regions of phase space through
which momentum transfer maneuvers might reasonably be expected to succeed, but which are
destabilized by the presence of the damping mechanism.<br>

WHEELS SUPPORTED ON ACTIVE MAGNETIC
BEARINGS USING H -LOOP-SHAPING AND
É -SYNTHESIS
Alexander Lanzon .Panagiotis Tsiotras<br></a>
The main objective of this research s to improve the feasibility of Energy
Momentum Wheels for satellite systems through the development of robust LTI and
gain-scheduled controllers for high-speed .ywheel rotors supported on active magnetic
bearings.A hybrid combination between H Åáloop-shaping and É -synthesis is used in
this paper to design controllers.In order to reduce the computational complexity of
the control designs and the order of the synthesized controllers,a method s devised
in this paper to reduce the number of states that depend on the rotor speed.The
rotor speed is treated as uncertainty in an LTI controller design and s used as a
scheduling variable for a gain-scheduled framework.The success of the methodology
used is demonstrated through numerical simulation and experimental results.<br>

DISCRETE DAMPER. Ralph A. Sandfry<br></a>
We investigate the possible equilibria for a torque-free gyrostat
with an attached spring-mass damper. The equations of motion are presented as well as explicit stability conditions for
simple spins. We numerically determine additional equilibria
using numerical continuation and rotor momentum as the bifurcation parameter. Multiple equilibria are presented, including stable equilibria corresponding to steady spins in nontrivial
directions. A pitchfork bifurcation of the nominal-spin state is
examined analytically using Liapunov-Schmidt reduction, which
produces conditions on system parameters for avoiding a jump
phenomenon.<br>

Management for LEO Earth-Pointing Satellites<br></a>
The optimal controllers for the management of 3-axis reaction-wheel momentum of
rigid Earth-pointing satellites are analyzed in detail using magnetorquers and/or thrusters.
Especially, two novel, optimal combined control schemes are proposed in order to achieve rapid,
propellant-saving reaction wheel momentum dumping control by employing magnetorquers and
thrusters. Finally, simulation results are presented to demonstrate the superiority of these
algorithms. These two combined algorithms could easily be applied in real-time onboard an LEO
Earth-pointing satellite.<br>

CATSAT is a small 3-axis stabilised satellite in the STEDI program, to be launched in 1999. This paper describes the development of the attitude control system, with emphasis on the control laws. The 2 primary modes are the safe-hold and science modes. The safe-hold mode uses a momentum wheel, magnetometers and torque coils, with the "B-dot" algorithm. The science mode also uses momentum bias and torque coils, with Sun sensors and horizon sensors, to maintain 3-axis control. The use of reaction wheel control is also being studied. The expected performance is demonstrated by simulations.<br>
