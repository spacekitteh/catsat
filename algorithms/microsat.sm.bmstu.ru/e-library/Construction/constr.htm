The purpose of this document is two-fold. It is a compilation of the Emerald design achieved by
the end of Spring Quarter 1999. Second, it is intended as a “must read” for new members of the structures
and mechanisms team. The information contained here should fully brief a new member on the work
already performed, the rational for all major design decisions, and the issues that are critical to each system.

The main objective of this paper is to introduce another
alternative for satellite structural platforms specially suitable
for micro and mini satellites. A brief description of how this
approach was conceived, analyzed, tested and optimized is
included. Herein are also presented the corresponding sizing
formulae and general recommendations for a satisfactory
design of this approach.<br>

<p><a href="busstru.pdf">DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF A ONE-PIECE MULTIFUNCTIONAL SMALL SATELLITE BUS STRUCTURE<br></a>
This paper describes the design and
manufacture of a multifunctional space structure.
The analytical techniques used in this project
included thermal analyses of structures in various
earth orbits, determination of structural
requirements from optical performance
calculations, designing of near zero Coefficient of
Thermal Expansion (CTE) laminates,
consideration of manufacturing and material
variations in design, strength analysis of
composite laminates, determination of vibration
modes and associated frequencies of tubular
structures with anisotropic sandwich construction
walls, and optimization of composite sandwich
structures considering all of the above factors.
The manufacturing technologies needed to build
such a structure were also developed. These
technologies included the building of co-cured
honeycomb panels, curved panels, core splices,
and tubular sections. These efforts culminated in
the production of a space-worthy component.<br>

<p><a href="catsat.pdf">CATSAT Structural Design<br></a>
CATSAT(Cooperative Astrophysical and Technology SATellite) is
based upon an inexpensive, light, stiff and
easily assembled structure. This paper
details the overall design philosophy,
manufacturing processes, and initial test
results. The design utilizes flat aluminum
panels that are screwed and bonded together,
resulting in a stiff structure that costs less
than $3000 and requires less than 40 hours
to assemble. Honeycomb panels and rivets
are not used in this structure making it very
easy to manufacture, service and
accommodate modifications.<br>

This paper presents an overview of the EO-1 mission
followed by a discussion of the management concept
that drives the EO-1 team. The paper details some of
the challenges on the EO-1 program that have been
overcome largely by the institution of this management
approach. Examples will be given on how the EO-1
management concept is implemented, specifically in the organization structure and how the organization
structure continues to evolve to meet the changing
needs of the EO-1 program.<br></a>
