This document provides an explanation of each part of MIL-STD-1553 on a
clause-by-clause basis. Each clause of the Standard is presented for complete-ness
(typed in italics for easy reference) together with appropriate explanation
or interpretation wherever necessary.Although the Standard specifies a multiplex data bus for aerospace applications,
it is by no means limited to these applications.This Standard also defines the concept of
operation and information flow on the multiplex data bus and the electrical and
functional formats to be employed.<br>

Tutorial</a><br>
MIL-STD-1553 is a military standard that defines the electrical and
protocol characteristics for a data bus. A data bus is used to provide a
medium for the exchange of data and information between various
systems. It is similar to what the personal computer and office automation
industry has dubbed a Local Area Network (LAN).
This guide provides an introduction to the MIL-STD-1553 data bus, its
history, applications, and use. It describes:<br>
-The physical elements that make up the bus<br>
-The protocol, including the message formats, word types, and
command and status words.<br>
-Status word bits and mode commands and their definitions and use,
both from the remote terminal and bus controller perspective.<br>
-Issues such as bus loading, major and minor frame timing, and error
recovery.<br>

<p><a href="mil-std-1750a.pdf">SIXTEEN-BIT COMPUTER INSTRUCTION SET ARCHITECTURE.</a><br>
This standard defines the instruction set architecture (ISA) for
airborne computers. It does not define specific implementation details of
a computer. The purpose of this document is to establish a uniform instruc-
tion set architecture for airborne computers which shall be used in Air Force
avionic weapon systems.<br>
