<br>
The results given in this paper focus on the heat-shield
design, the flight dynamics, and the thermal
loads associated with the re-entry. The heat-shield
used for BREM-SAT 2 is a so-called parashield
which resembles a reinforced umbrella and increases
the satellites front area by a factor of 12. The initial
diameter of 0.65 m during launch and orbital flight
changes to 2.24 m when deployed. This shifts the
peak of the deceleration loads to an altitude of 70 km;
in contrast, the peak-load altitude of a standard re-entry
capsule is about 40 km. Part of the heat flux is
absorbed by the flow due to the blunt cone design,
and the temperature is significantly lowered by the
large emission area on the front and the back of the
heat-shield. Lower temperatures allow the use of
conventional, off-the-shelf available materials, like the
silicon fabric of the heat-shield originally used for
high temperature insulation in terrestrial applications.<br>

for subsurface soil collection and analysis on Mars <br></a>
The continued exploration of Mars is a high priority item
within NASA’s interplanetary science community. It has
long been a desire of this group to define an experiment
that would investigate the possible presence and location
of water/ice beneath the Martian surface. Until recently,
however, there has not been a flight experiment dedicated
to achieving this goal. This paper describes a concept
design effort conducted at Sandia National Labs in
collaboration with JPL and CalTech that has produced a
feasible flight system to investigate this question.<br>
