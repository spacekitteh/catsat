SCOPE This specification is for the thermal subsystem of a CubeSat. This subsystem will monitor and
control the temperatures of the satellite and its other subsystems such that all components are
maintained in their respective operating and non-operating required range.<br>

The miniaturization of cryogenic components
plays a significant role in the never ending
quest for "smaller, better, faster, cheaper"
satellite systems. My advisor and I are
developing three separate applicable
technologies for the thermal control of small
satellite systems. The first of these
technologies is called FiST (Fiber Support
Technology).(...) The second of these
technologies is the development of a
solderless flexible thermal link. The third area of advancement
in thermal control which we are studying is
controlling the reject temperature of cryogenic
mechanical refrigerators. By maintaining a
stable, lower reject temperature the efficiency
of these mechanical refrigerators is greatly
enhanced which results in lower power
consumption and/or greater cooling capacity
for the cooled satellite systems. The weight
and power savings make this approach an
important part of small satellite thermal
control. This paper briefly describes the basic
concepts behind these thermal control
technologies and their potential benefits to
small satellite systems.<br>
