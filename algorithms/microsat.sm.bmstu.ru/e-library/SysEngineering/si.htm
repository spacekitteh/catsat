The intent of this technical report is to make the practice of Software
Risk Evaluation (SRE) available for use throughout the software
system development community, without requiring that the
SEI (or even authorized representatives of the SEI) come to your
location to do the process for you. You should be able to follow
and customize this process for yourself, ultimately using a self-prepared
team of four or five people with facilitation skills to produce
a sound risk baseline for a project or program.<br>

The ALUMINATE Project originated at the University of Queensland (UQ) in
early 2000 with the Moon as the objective. However, preliminary analysis of
the engineering requirements of such a venture suggested that Mars might
be a more scientifically valuable and commercially viable target that could be
reached without a dramatic increase in cost or engineering complexity.
Analysis also suggested that Venus might be a viable alternative to Mars,
particularly because of the substantially enhanced solar energy available to a
spacecraft journeying to Venus as compared one journeying away from the
Sun to Mars.<br>

The cost criterion, with reference to NEAR (Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous),
is the focus of this paper. This paper will discuss
the NEAR program cost from the beginning of
Phase C/D (December 1993) to launch plus 30
days (March 1996). The NEAR work breakdown
structure (WBS) will be presented and each of
its 29 cost centers will be discussed in detail with
regard to their total cost, manpower required,
engineering and fabrication shop hours required,
and subcontract cost (with a brief description of
the major subcontracts). In addition to the
utilization of the WBS, showing the cost make
up of each cost center, several other graphs and
charts will be presented to show these same cost
areas (total cost, manpower, shop hours, and
subcontracts) in relation to the phases (design
and fabrication, integration and test, launch
support, etc.) in which they were expended. Also
incorporated in this paper will be discussions
on some key cost control techniques—some tried
and proven in past programs, and others fairly
new to JHU/APL—regarding technical services
and subcontract support.<br>

OF NON-GEO SMALLSATS BUSES/LAUNCHERS.<br></a>
This paper provides a methodology to reduce cost and
optimize the selection of this combination, for Low &
Medium earth orbits satellites. This generalized
approach for elliptical orbits, is extended from a
previous paper on circular non-GEO orbits. It provides
equations for the net payload power and mass available
to the system, for varying bus launcher sets, for
elliptical (and circular) orbits, taking into account orbit
eccentricity, mass to orbit, power generation/storage
and fuel required for drag make-up. Some selected
examples are provided for the payload power and mass
for different launchers and the total payload equivalent
mass at varying elliptical altitudes. This methodology
is adequate for a first cut optimization, for elliptical
LEO’s and MEO’s, with direct injection launches.
Further refinements require detailed knowledge of the
power system as well as other data of a given bus,
which are best evaluated with the bus manufacturers.<br>

<p><a href="pricecos.pdf">The Danish Small Satellite Programme<br></a>
This paper examines the 10 case study
space missions presented in the new book,
Reducing Space Mission Cost. Relative to
the projections of traditional cost models
(our best estimate of “should have cost”),
these missions reduced total program cost by
50% to more than 90%.
Cost reductions have come about in all
mission segments—the spacecraft bus,payload, launch, ground segment, and
mission operations. This paper summarizes
the cost reduction methods employed by
these missions to provide a first answer to
the title question.<br>

<p><a href="simplif.pdf">A Simplified Use of Quality Function Deployment
as a System Tool for Designing to Cost<br></a>The problem of designing to cost is
one with which industry is still
grappling. A technique of requirement
development, analysis, and refinement is
applied to a university-class satellite
development project. A simplified form
of the Quality Function Deployment
process was followed and allowed to
structure the entire design process. It
aided in evolving a mission scope which
resulted in a feasible mission.
This paper presents the steps
developed for a senior-level, spacecraft
design course. Its application to the
design of a low-cost wireless power
transmission experiment will be
illustrated from requirements generation
well into the satellite design. Cost was
the prime driver in developing a feasible
mission. Use of the technique allowed a
cost versus benefit analysis of mission
science suggested by previous studies
and helped to reduce the cost by more
than a factor of four over those studies.
Two conditions necessary for
success in designing to cost are
suggested. One pertains to the
organization generating the mission
requirements, and the other to a
paradigm shift for designers.
Potential applications for
university satellites and instructors
developing missions for senior satellite-design
courses are suggested.<br>

<p><a href="Spacecraft_Systems_Engineering.pdf">Spacecraft Systems Engineering – The Initiation of a
Multidisciplinary Design Project at the University of North Dakota<br></a>This
multidisciplinary design project emphasizes the systems engineering approach, in which extensive
documentation is created prior to any construction or testing. Fourteen undergraduate and three
graduate students designed and tested the second build of a spacecraft, known as Scorpio II, to be
launched using a zero-pressure balloon. This project will send a 10-kg spacecraft to an elevation of
approximately 25-km to collect and transmit real-time sensor and digital image data from the
stratosphere. The telecommunications subsystem is responsible for collecting sensor readings,
acquiring images from a digital camera, and packetizing this data so that it can be transmitted to a
ground station via a radio-frequency (RF) link. The RF link will be implemented using a
commercial, off-the-shelf (COTS) transceiver. Furthermore, the telecommunications subsystem will
be able to receive uplink telecommands for controlling image acquisition, varying the sampling
frequency of individual sensors, and releasing the payload from the balloon. The spacecraft –
attached to a parachute – will be tracked with global positioning system (GPS) data so that it may be
safely recovered after its descent. The large-scale scope of this project, coupled with the group size,
has led to many new experiences for the students, including an appreciation for true teamwork and
the positive and negative aspects of group dynamics. The efficacy of applying this systems
engineering approach to a variety of large-scale student projects, such as spacecraft or solar-powered
vehicle design, will be discussed.<br>

SYSTEMS ANALYSIS<br></a>
This paper describes the mathematical foundation and algorithmic development of a multidisciplinary
design optimization technique to provide spacecraft performance optimization in a constrained environment. The
method introduced, referred to here as the Early Small Satellite System Analysis Method (ESSAM), incorporates the
use optimization algorithms to provide insight into the effect individual technologies have on performance and cost
parameters even when the system is at a low definition of design. This high-fidelity knowledge brought to the early
stages of the design process allow the spacecraft concept architecture, technology choices, and performance
requirements to be adjusted to meet an overall estimated cost goal, thereby enabling spacecraft design to be
completed in a more economical and timely manner. The method described in this paper is an extension of previous
work done at the University of Colorado in multidisciplinary research modeling and optimization as related to
spacecraft design.<br>
