<p><a href="../Power/MAX1280.pdf">400ksps/300ksps, Single-Supply, Low-Power, 8-Channel,
Serial 12-Bit ADCs with Internal Reference<br></a>
The MAX1280/MAX1281 12-bit ADCs combine an 8-chan-nel
analog-input multiplexer, high-bandwidth track/hold,
and serial interface with high conversion speed and low
power consumption. The MAX1280 operates from a single
+4.5V to +5.5V supply; the MAX1281 operates from a single
+2.7V to +3.6V supply. Both devices’ analog inputs
are software configurable for unipolar/bipolar and single-ended/
pseudo-differential operation.<br>

<p><a href="../Power/MAX549A.pdf">+2.5V to +5.5V, Low-Power, Single/Dual,
8-Bit Voltage-Output DACs in µMAX Package<br></a>
The MAX548A/MAX549A/MAX550A serial, 8-bit voltage-output
digital-to-analog converters (DACs) operate from
a single +2.5V to +5.5V supply. Their ±1LSB TUE specification
is guaranteed over temperature. Operating current
(supply current plus reference current) is typically
75µA per DAC with VDD = 2.5V. In shutdown, the DAC
is disconnected from the reference, reducing current
drain to less than 1µA. The MAX548A/MAX549A allow
each DAC to be shut down independently.
The 10MHz, 3-wire serial interface is compatible with
SPI™/QSPI™ and Microwire™ interface standards.
Double-buffered inputs provide flexibility when updating
the DACs; the input and DAC registers can be
updated individually or simultaneously.<br>

Design of a Power Supply System for DTUsat<br></a>
This paper is the result of a combined mid-curriculum / special course project carried out at Eltek at
the Technical University of Denmark. It is about the design of a power supply for the first Danish
student satellite, DTUsat. The paper describes the choice of solar cells, batteries and converter
topologies considered for the design. This is based on a discussion and feasibility study of the power
budget. Furthermore space related issues, especially radiation, is studied. As the construction of the
power supply is not yet complete, future plans of the project are described.<br>

WITH ADVANCED NiH2 DEPENDENT PRESSURE VESSEL (DPV) BATTERIES<br></a>
In this presentation, we will discuss design
features and present test data from existing development
cells and address issues relevant to
design and production of a DPV battery suitable
for a small satellite application which would retain
the energy increases and weight and cost reductions
proposed. With the DPV, EPI has combined
the unique features and significant advantages
of NiH 2 electrochemistry with the simplicity
and extensive design heritage of the NiCd battery system.<br>
