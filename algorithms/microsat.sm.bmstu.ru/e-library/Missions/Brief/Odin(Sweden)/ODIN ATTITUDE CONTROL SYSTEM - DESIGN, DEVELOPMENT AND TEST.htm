<H2 align=center><SMALL><B>ABSTRACT</B> </SMALL></H2>
<P><SMALL>This paper presents the Swedish science satellite project Odin with 
emphasis on the attitude control system. The attitude control system features 
high accuracy three-axis stabilised control using star trackers and gyros as 
primary sensors. The on-board attitude determination and control signal 
calculation is performed by a dedicated attitude control and determination 
computer. The attitude control system is tested on many levels, from equipment 
test to complete system tests, using various simulators and test equipment. 
</SMALL></P>
<P><SMALL>The attitude control system is described on a general level. A more 
detailed presentation of the on-board attitude control and determination 
computer, its software development and test is given. Finally, the functional 
and performance tests of the attitude control system are described. </SMALL>
<OL>
  <H2 align=center><SMALL>BACKGROUND </SMALL></H2></OL>
<P><SMALL>Odin is a small, low-cost, satellite with a combined astronomy and 
atmospheric research (aeronomy) mission. The Odin project is a co-operation 
between space agencies and scientists in Sweden, Canada, Finland and France. The 
main objective of the astronomy mission is to study star formation and early 
solar systems. The main objective of the atmospheric research mission is to 
study ozone layer depletion mechanisms and extent. The Odin payload is a 1.1 
metre Gregorian telescope with a sub-millimetre and millimetre radiometer and an 
optical spectrograph. These wavelengths contain spectral lines of, among others, 
O<SUB>2</SUB> and H<SUB>2</SUB>O molecules; and are absorbed by the earth 
atmosphere. This requires the observations to be made from space. </SMALL></P>
<P><SMALL>Odin is planned to be launched on February 15, 2001,&nbsp; into a 
circular sun-synchronous orbit at 600 km. The ascending node will be at 18:00 
local time. Odin weighs approximately 250 kg and has a design-life of 2 years. 
</SMALL></P>

width=305><BR clear=both><A name=_Ref373554360></A>Figure 1.<I> The Odin STM at 
vibration tests (photo by Saab Ericsson Space AB).</I> </SMALL></P>
<P><SMALL>The telescope is fixed to the spacecraft body. Hence, the telescope is 
moved and pointed in the desired direction by moving and stabilising the entire 
spacecraft body. To make this possible the attitude control system (ACS) 
features 3-axis stabilisation with high accuracy, both during inertial pointing 
towards celestial targets and during scanning of the earth atmosphere. Since 
Odin is a small spacecraft with a low-cost profile, complicated mechanisms or a 
"double" control system cannot be used. Instead, the approach taken is to 
perform also the earth pointing part of the mission with inertial reference, 
using star trackers and gyros as main sensors. Actuators are reaction wheels and 
magnetic coils. </SMALL></P>
<P><SMALL>The Swedish Space Corporation (SSC) is prime contractor for the 
spacecraft, under contract to the Swedish National Space Board, and has the 
overall responsibility for the design, development and test of the Odin ACS. The 
main sensors, star trackers and gyros are provided by France, together with 
technical support from CNES, as a contribution to the project. As part of the 
Canadian contribution to the project, the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) has 
developed a test facility and performs testing of the ACS on system level. The 
attitude control and determination computer (ACDC) hardware and software are 
developed by Saab Ericsson Space AB (SE) under a contract to SSC. </SMALL>
<OL>
  <H2 align=center><SMALL>THE ATTITUDE CONTROL SYSTEM </SMALL></H2></OL>
<P><SMALL>All data-handling on the Odin platform is performed by the Odin System 
Unit (OSU). The OSU contains several processing units. Among these are the ACDC 
which carries out the attitude determination and control. The sensors and 
actuators of the ACS are connected to dedicated interface processors that take 
care of the communication with the on-board communication network. The ACDC 
receives sensor data and sends actuator commands through this on-board 
communication network. Hence, the ACDC has no direct interface to any sensor or 
actuator and the interface problems are resolved in the specification and 
implementation of the software in the interface processors. </SMALL></P>
<P><SMALL>The attitude control system of Odin is based on sensors and actuators 
with good flight heritage. The two <B>star trackers</B> (from Sodern, France) 
provide the ACS with high accuracy star direction information. The star trackers 
are mounted on the telescope structure with angular separation of 40 
symmetrically around the telescope line of sight. In this way one star tracker 
will face the sky while the telescope is directed towards the earth limb for 
aeronomy observations. The three <B>gyro packages</B> (from Sagem, France) 
provide high accuracy angular rate information. Each gyro package gives two axis 
information so the three together ensures a six to three redundancy. 
</SMALL></P>
<P><SMALL>The four <B>reaction wheels</B> (from Ithaco, USA), with 4 Nms 
capacity each, are the main actuators for the attitude control. Three of them 
are mounted orthogonally. The fourth is mounted iso-angular to the three others 
and serves as backup for any one of these. Three <B>magnetorquers 
</B>(electromagnetic coils, from SSC and ACR, Sweden) are used to dump momentum 
from reaction wheels and for the detumble emergency mode. </SMALL></P>
<P><SMALL>Three <B>coarse sun sensors</B> (from Matra Marconi Space, France) and 
two <B>fine sun sensors</B> (from ACR, Sweden) provide coverage around the 
entire spacecraft and give an accurate value of the sun angle within a 76 
top-angle cone around the spacecraft -z axis, perpendicular to the solar panels. 
</SMALL></P>
<P><SMALL>Two <B>3-axis magnetometers</B> (from SSC) provide attitude 
information of lower accuracy to the ACS. <BR></SMALL></P>

openings are seen on each side of the +x corner.</I> </SMALL></P>
<OL>
  <H2 align=center><SMALL>ATTITUDE CONTROL MODES </SMALL></H2></OL>
<P><SMALL>Several operating modes are defined for the ACS. Roughly, they can be 
divided in three categories, Safe &amp; Detumble, Standby and Normal modes. 
</SMALL></P>
<H3><SMALL>Normal modes</SMALL></H3>
<P><SMALL>In these modes the required scientific observation programs (astronomy 
and aeronomy) are performed. All normal modes use the gyros and star trackers as 
prime sensors. The reaction wheels are the main actuators. The magnetorquers are 
used before a large slew manoeuvre to reduce gyroscopic coupling between the 
different control axes. </SMALL></P>
<P><SMALL>In <I>Astronomy</I> observation modes the telescope is directed 
towards celestial targets. The observation target is observed for an extended 
time (<I>staring</I>). The telescope can be directed alternately at the 
observation target and an adjacent calibration target (<I>staring with position 
switch)</I>. It is also possible to perform <I>mapping, </I>where a sequence of 
adjacent points are targeted. </SMALL></P>
<P><SMALL>In <I>Aeronomy </I>the telescope is pointed at, and follows the earth 
limb. Either a constant altitude is targeted (<I>pointing</I>) or the limb is 
scanned in an interval between 7 and 120 km. The scanning can be 
<I>continuous</I> or <I>stepwise</I>. In aeronomy mode observations are mostly 
made in the orbit plane, but observations off-orbit-plane (up to 32) are 
possible. </SMALL></P>
<H3><SMALL>Safe mode </SMALL></H3>
<P><SMALL>The safe mode is a sun-pointing mode, which means that the solar 
array's normal is pointed towards the sun. In safe mode the only sensors used 
are the coarse and fine sun sensors, and the magnetometers. </SMALL></P>
<H3><SMALL>Detumble mode </SMALL></H3>
<P><SMALL>The detumble mode is a rate reduction control mode, i.e. no pointing 
control is applied. This mode is entered when too high attitude rates are 
obtained for the satellite. In detumble mode only the magnetometers and 
magnetorquers are used for the rate damping using a simple B-dot control law. 
</SMALL></P>
<H3><SMALL>Standby </SMALL></H3>
<P><SMALL>In the standby mode full 3-axis control and inertial pointing is 
maintained. From standby mode the normal modes can be entered. The standby mode 
is also the back-up mode in case an error should occur in a normal mode. 
</SMALL></P>
<H3><SMALL>Momentum management </SMALL></H3>
<P><SMALL>A momentum management function is used to unload the reaction wheels 
when their speeds exceed certain limits. The momentum management function is 
active in all modes except detumble. </SMALL>
<OL>
  <H2 align=center><SMALL>ACS PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS </SMALL></H2></OL>
<P><SMALL>The absolute pointing accuracy in <U>astronomy</U> (staring) shall be 
better than 15 arc-seconds (1) half cone angle pitch and yaw. Of these 15 
arc-seconds, seven are allocated to the telescope (thermal deformation etc.). 
This means that the ACS itself has to maintain an absolute pointing accuracy of 
eight arc-seconds, which shall be obtained after in-orbit calibration. 
</SMALL></P>
<P><SMALL>In <U>aeronomy</U> the reconstructed attitude accuracy over the entire 
orbit shall be better than (pitch, yaw, roll) = (2, 10, 15) arc-minutes (1.3). 
The real-time tracking accuracy over the entire orbit shall be better than 
(pitch, yaw, roll) = (6, 50, 15) arc-minutes (1.3). </SMALL></P>
<H2 align=center><SMALL>THE ACDC </SMALL></H2>
<P><SMALL>The ACDC hardware is based on a SE developed 32 bit microprocessor 
(Thor) designed for Ada coded real-time applications. </SMALL></P>
<P><SMALL>The redundancy level of the ACDC is twofold, i.e. two identical ACDC:s 
are available on the computer board. They are electrically identical, working on 
two TM systems and are separately powered from the OSU. The software running in 
the two computers are also identical but can, before or during the flight, be 
individually changed. </SMALL></P>
<P><SMALL>The software is written in Ada, which imposes structure, discipline 
and a certain style. This facilitates software maintenance and thus late changes 
in software requirements; also a large part of the detailed documentation is 
made in the code. Hence, the use of Ada reduces the project time and cost. 
</SMALL></P>
<H3><SMALL>THE ACDC APPLICATION </SMALL></H3>
<P><SMALL>The main functions of the ACDC are: sensor data evaluation, attitude 
determination, attitude control, momentum management, actuator commanding and 
evaluation, star tracker control, executing ACDC related telecommands including 
mode changes, parameter changes and attitude reference calculations. 
</SMALL></P>
<H4><SMALL>Attitude determination </SMALL></H4>
<P><SMALL>To estimate the attitude and body rates of the Odin spacecraft an 
extended Kalman filter is used. The filter can run in two modes: either with 
star trackers and gyros (standby and normal modes) or without primary sensors 
(safe mode). Both modes are based on a Kalman filter with six states estimating 
the body attitude and gyro or body rates. Different filter parameters are 
selected depending on mode. </SMALL></P>
<P><SMALL>A star identification and star tracker control function processes the 
star tracker sensor data. Depending on observation program the star trackers are 
commanded by the ACDC to search for, and lock on, stars in the entire field of 
view (7° x 10°) or in specified windows. After identification from an onboard 
star catalogue containing 512 stars the star trackers are commanded to track the 
stars until they leave the field of view. The management of the star catalogue 
is performed by ACDC commands from the ground segment. The star tracker control 
function allows for tracking up to six stars simultaneously (three per star 
tracker). </SMALL></P>
<H3><SMALL>ACDC HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE STRUCTURE </SMALL></H3>
<H4><SMALL>Hardware </SMALL></H4>
<P><SMALL>The two ACDC:s are implemented on a single 130 x 212 mm board. 
Redundancy switching is controlled from the OSU level, ref./1/. </SMALL></P>
<P><SMALL>Each ACDC is equipped with a Thor 32 bit microprocessor running at 
6MHz; 32 kword (32 bit) RAM and 32 kword EEPROM with Error Detection And 
Correction (EDAC); 2 kword PROM; and a serial bus interface. This configuration 
gives a performance corresponding to 4 MIPS DAIS. </SMALL></P>
<P><SMALL>The Thor microprocessor is manufactured in a Radiation Tolerant 0.85 
mm process and radiation tests show that the device is functional at a total 
dose of 100 krad (Si). </SMALL></P>
<H4><SMALL>Software </SMALL></H4>
<P><SMALL>The total Ada flight software is divided in two separate programs: 
</SMALL></P>
<P><SMALL>The <I>Bootstrap</I> program code is stored in PROM. This program 
contains vital basic functions such as TM network communication interface and 
memory load/ dump functions. </SMALL></P>
<P><SMALL>The <I>Normal Operation</I> program code is stored in EEPROM, which is 
possible to re-program. This program contains the complete flight software. It 
also contains the vital basic functions of the Bootstrap program in order to 
minimise the switching between the two programs. </SMALL></P>
<P><SMALL>After power up of the computer, the Bootstrap program is executing. 
After a time-out, execution is transferred to the Normal Operation program. The 
Normal Operation program executes four tasks: the bus network interface, two 
attitude control tasks (2 and 16 Hz) and a background task. </SMALL></P>
<H3><SMALL>ACDC SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT </SMALL></H3>
<P><SMALL>The software development is influenced by the low cost profile of Odin 
and the scope of the work that includes requirement analysis, software 
architecture, design of control loops and attitude determination algorithms, 
implementation, coding and tests. The basis is to use a small team where each 
member has responsibility of well distinguished functions. The responsibility 
includes all development phases. The software development process follows the 
ESA Software Engineering Standard, except that the detailed design and coding 
are not separated. </SMALL></P>
<H4><SMALL>Module Tests </SMALL></H4>
<P><SMALL>The purpose of module testing is to show that the software modules 
function according to the requirements as stated in the <I>Software 
Architectural Design Document </I>(ADD). These requirements are traced to the 
<I>Software Requirements Document</I> (SRD). </SMALL></P>
<P><SMALL>The major part of the modules are tested by running the code in the 
Thor processor on a PC board. The possibility to use a PC for execution of 
program in the target micro-processor is found to be very cost effective. Some 
code analysis is also needed in order to cover all requirements of the SRD. 
</SMALL></P>
<P><SMALL>Automatic test tools are used as far as possible for testing and 
evaluation of test results. </SMALL></P>
<H4><SMALL>Integration Tests </SMALL></H4>
<P><SMALL>These tests are performed when the modules are integrated in larger 
and larger blocks until the complete ACDC program is achieved. These tests are 
performed on the Thor PC board, except for the final integration tests of the 
complete program in the ACDC flight-model (FM) hardware. </SMALL></P>
<H4><SMALL>Acceptance tests </SMALL></H4>
<P><SMALL>After integration the ACDC software is handed over to SSC for 
acceptance testing. During these tests the software runs on the ACDC FM 
hardware. The ACDC is connected to a real-time spacecraft simulator developed by 
SSC for this purpose. </SMALL></P>
<H2 align=center><SMALL>TEST SIMULATOR </SMALL></H2>
<P><SMALL>The ACDC test simulator contains a hardware interface to the ACDC and 
a real-time simulation software that includes simulation of the spacecraft body 
motion, spacecraft environment, actuators and sensors. </SMALL></P>
<P><SMALL>The simulator is hosted in a single processor 133MHz Pentium machine 
with 32MB memory. The interface between the simulator and the ACDC is supplied 
by a ISA-bus extension card with MC68302 micro processor. This card establishes 
the on-board TM format and provides a TM interface to the Odin EGSE. 
</SMALL></P>
<P><SMALL>The simulator also provides a software interface to the flight 
software. The ACDC flight software Ada code is then compiled in the PC using a 
commercial Ada compiler. The compiled flight software can thus be run locally in 
the simulator host. This enables easy access to the flight software for setting 
breakpoints etc. </SMALL></P>
<P><SMALL>The simulator is developed by SSC in C++ using object-oriented 
techniques. This has been found beneficial since a good correspondence between 
simulated entities and implementation can be achieved. </SMALL></P>
<P><SMALL>The dynamic parts of the simulator are implemented using a C-code 
generator supplied with the Matlab/Simulink tool. Dynamic models of the 
spacecraft body, the gyros and the reaction wheels are made using Simulink. 
</SMALL>
<OL>
  <H2 align=center><SMALL>ACS FUNCTIONAL TESTS </SMALL></H2></OL>
<P><SMALL>Functional tests of the attitude control system are performed in a 
laboratory environment by the Canadian Space Agency in Ottawa, Canada. 
</SMALL></P>
<H3><SMALL>TEST OBJECTIVES </SMALL></H3>
<P><SMALL>The functional tests consist of a series of so-called open-loop and 
closed-loop tests. Open-loop tests evaluate the performance and operation of the 
gyro packages and star trackers by themselves. Closed-loop tests evaluate the 
performance of the ACS system as a whole, combining the sensors, the ACDC and 
OSU with a real-time simulation of the ACS actuators, spacecraft body dynamics 
and disturbance torque. </SMALL></P>
<H3><SMALL>SYSTEM CONFIGURATION </SMALL></H3>
<P><SMALL>The spacecraft hardware and software used in the tests includes OSU, 
ACDC, mass memory and interfaces to sensors and actuators, gyro packages and 
star trackers. </SMALL></P>
<P><SMALL>The star tracker optical head (OH) is mounted on a 2-axis motion table 
in front of a simulated starfield. The focal plane of the OH is centred on the 
axis of rotation of the table. The test fixture, which is continuously purged 
with dry air, provides a hermetic enclosure for the OH. A high quality optical 
glass plate affords the star tracker an unobstructed field of view. Gyro 
packages, gyro electronics units (EUs) and the star tracker EU are installed 
above the OH fixture. The orientation of the gyros with respect to one another 
and to the optical head is representative of the installation in the Odin 
spacecraft; and such that the motion table axes corresponds to the spacecraft 
pitch and yaw axes (Figure 3 and Figure 4). </SMALL></P>
<P><SMALL>For the closed-loop tests the real time simulator is connected to the 
OSU directly through the analogue and digital I/O provided for the real ACS 
sensors and actuators. A modification to the OSU software provides earth rate 
compensation for gyro data based on actual gyro orientation data provided by the 
data acquisition system during each test. The ACDC software is completely flight 
representative. </SMALL></P>
<H3><SMALL>OPEN-LOOP TESTS </SMALL></H3>
<P><SMALL>Open-loop gyro tests examine the warm-up, drift stability, drift 
coefficients and rate performance characteristics of the gyro packages. Tests 
are performed with all three gyro packages on the motion table at the same time, 
and are repeated at 25, 35 and 40 C. The gyro misalignment is measured using the 
gyro optical alignment cubes. Drift coefficients are determined from 
multi-position tests. Approximately 60 hours are required to complete the gyro 
tests. </SMALL></P>
<P><SMALL>Open-loop star tracker tests evaluate the performance and behaviour of 
the star trackers in static and dynamic tests. Static tests are used to 
determine the point-spread function, CCD dark current, optical head alignment 
and intensity measurement in mapping mode. Dynamic tests evaluate the mapping, 
tracking and chaining-up star tracker modes at rates to 0.065 per second. 
</SMALL></P>
<P><SMALL>Mimic tests are defined for certain normal mode operations to obtain 
data from the gyros and star trackers under conditions that are representative 
of actual spacecraft motion. <BR></SMALL></P>

<H3><SMALL>CLOSED LOOP TESTS </SMALL></H3>
<P><SMALL>Closed loop tests verify the behaviour and performance of essential 
ACS modes and functions with emphasis on the normal astronomy and aeronomy and 
standby functions. </SMALL></P>
<P><SMALL>Closed-loop test scenarios are designed to represent real spacecraft 
operation scenarios for all modes; with an emphasis on the normal modes. The 
scenarios are designed to minimise the spacecraft motion about its roll axis to 
minimise the limitations imposed by the 2-axis motion table. The OSU is 
commanded from the Odin electrical ground support equipment (EGSE) and the 
command scripts for the tests are prepared with the same tools that will be used 
in the Odin control centre. The EGSE displays and logs all telemetry data during 
the tests. </SMALL></P>

configuration. The distance between the motion table and the starfield simulator 
is 2.5 m.</I> </SMALL></P>
<H3><SMALL>SIMULATION </SMALL></H3>
<P><SMALL>The real time simulator is based on mathematical models of the 
spacecraft dynamics, disturbance torque and ACS actuators and sensors. Xmath 
scripts and Systembuild block diagram modelling tools are used to implement the 
simulator code. The simulator runs on an Integrated Systems RealSim model 3 
AC-100 computer system using two i860 application processors. </SMALL></P>
<P><SMALL>The spacecraft dynamics model numerically integrates Euler's equations 
of motion to compute the dynamic response to disturbance torques and the ACS 
applied torque. Rigid and flexible body dynamics with calculated moments of 
inertia are provided. The motion table is controlled such that the ACS sensor 
hardware tracks the attitude and attitude rates of the simulation. </SMALL></P>
<P><SMALL>The spacecraft environment model includes the Earth magnetic moment 
and gravity gradient vectors, aerodynamic drag and solar radiation pressure 
disturbance torque. Models are provided for ACS hardware including coarse and 
fine sun sensors, magnetometers, magnetorquers and reaction wheels. </SMALL></P>
<H3><SMALL>TEST EQUIPMENT </SMALL></H3>
<P><SMALL>The motion table used is a Contraves model 57CD 2-axis table, which 
has an accuracy of 2 arc-seconds and wobble of less than 3 arc-seconds. 
</SMALL></P>
<P><SMALL>The simulated starfield consists of 8 collimated point sources 
arranged to provide a 15 by 30 field of view. The starfield simulator, custom 
built for the Odin tests, uses a 40 watt tungsten halogen lamp to produce star 
intensities in the range of magnitude 1 to 6. Each point source is calibrated in 
intensity and colour using a series of optical filters. An optical fibre for 
each point source connects the filter rack to the star module containing a 
matched pair of convex and concave mirrors to produce a 50 mm diameter 
collimated beam. Each point source is precisely aligned to point directly at the 
focal plane of the optical head resting 2.5 metres away on the motion table. A 
bright object simulator is also provided to simulate the presence of the moon in 
or near the star tracker field of view. </SMALL></P>
<P><SMALL>Gyro and star tracker commands and data are time-tagged and logged by 
the data acquisition system. Data acquisition and motion table control software 
is implemented in C and Motif on a Sun Sparc-10 workstation under SunOS. 
</SMALL>
<OL>
  <H2 align=center><SMALL>CONCLUSIONS </SMALL></H2></OL>
<P><SMALL>Odin features an advanced ACS enabling a dual mission with accurate 
pointing at the earth atmosphere and at celestial objects using the same sets of 
sensors and actuators. To design, implement and test this ACS within a small, 
low-budget, project like Odin is a challenge for all involved. </SMALL></P>
<P><SMALL>The Odin platform provides the Swedish Space Corporation with a small 
3-axis stabilised platform concept to offer to its customers. The platform is 
readily adaptable to other missions requiring high-accuracy three-axis pointing. 
</SMALL></P>
<P><SMALL>The use of the Thor processor by Saab Ericsson Space demonstrates the 
processor and its accompanying Ada compiler as a cost-effective solution for 
demanding real-time space applications. The development of the Odin application 
software furthers the SE competence in this field. </SMALL></P>
<P><SMALL>The ACS functional testing demonstrates and enhances the Canadian 
Space Agency's capability to test and evaluate advanced attitude control systems 
and components within a small-satellite budget frame. </SMALL>
