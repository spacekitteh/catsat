<P>This question is still asked regarding the fate of UoSAT-4. Things have moved 
along since the fateful day when communications were lost with one of our twin 
microsats, so why should we look back so far? Well, although we can never 
conclusively prove what happened, there are valuable lessons to be learnt. After 
the demise of the satellite the entire system was checked for "single point 
failures", (sections of the system who's failure would prematurely end the 
mission), constructional weaknesses and component reliability issues. The 
results of this review proved invaluable to ensuring success of future 
satellites.<BR>
<P>In this paper I would like to present two possible RF failure modes, describe 
how they could have occurred and how the same effect was prevented from 
occurring on future missions.<BR>
<P><B><FONT size=5>Setting the Scene<BR></FONT></B>
<P>After the success of the two research missions, UoSAT 1 &amp; 2, launched on 
American Thor-Delta rockets a follow on mission, UoSAT-C, was due to be launched 
in 1988. However, due to changes in the launch manifest UoSAT-C was delayed. As 
a consequence of this the payloads were split between two new satellites, 
UoSAT-D &amp; E. In fact the planned development and construction time for the 
pair of satellite was in the order of six months. <BR>
<P>The primary mission objectives [<I>4</I>] were to provide:-<BR>
<OL>
  <LI>amateur radio communications using store and forward techniques 
  <LI>in orbit demonstration's of new technologies. 
  <LI>studies of the low earth orbit radiation environment 
  <LI>images of the Earth using a low cost CCD camera </LI></OL>
<P>
<P>The satellites were launched on January 23rd 1990 into an 800 km sun 
synchronous orbit aboard an Ariane-40 rocket [<I>3</I>]. The satellites were the 
first to be flown using the "ASAP" or <B>A</B>riane <B>S</B>tructure for 
<B>A</B>uxiliary <B>P</B>ayloads, an honour it shared with four AMSAT-NA 
microsatellites. Each satellite carried 2m receivers and 70 cm transmitters. 
Both satellites were successful injected into orbit and communications 
established. However, approximately 30 hours after launch all communication were 
lost with UoSAT-4. Despite extensive examination of all telemetry no indications 
of a fault condition were seen.<BR>
<P>An effort was made by Stanford Research Institute (SRI) to detect the 
receiver local oscillator (LO) signals using a 35 meter dish antenna [<I>1</I>] 
&amp; [<I>2</I>]. After considerable work Stanford <I><B>did</B></I> detect the 
receiver signals on several occasions despite reception occurring for only a 
matter of seconds. Significant post processing of the signals (taking several 
hours) was required to confirm reception. The results of their tracking efforts 
are shown in<I> figure 1</I>.<BR><BR>
<P><IMG

<P><B>The Quest Begins<BR></B>
<P>So what did the reception of the receivers LO signals tell us? Well, for a 
start we knew that the power system was still active, it therefore seemed 
unlikely that the satellite had been damaged by space debris as some people had 
suggested. In addition, it appeared that the receivers were still functional.<B> 
</B>If we make the assumption that the TT&amp;C system was still controlling the 
spacecraft we must then consider the transmitters.<BR>
<P>A long review of possible failure scenarios provide two possible RF 
mechanisms, these were:-<BR>
<OL>
  <LI>Failure of the antenna system. 
  <LI>Failure of the transmitter output filter. </LI></OL>
<P>
<P>It should be emphasised that these are only possible failure scenarios, it 
does not exclude the possibility of other mechanisms.<BR><BR>
<P><B><FONT size=5>The Antenna System<BR></FONT></B>
<P><IMG 
src="A Possible Explaination for the Failure of UoSAT-4_files/img00002.gif"> 
<BR>
<P>The RF system on UoSAT-4 consisted of three VHF receivers and two UHF 
transmitters. During normal operation all receivers were active and one downlink 
could be selected via a telecommand operated relay. Up and down link data rates 
were 1200 AFSK and 9600 FSK, though only 1200 AFSK was used during the 
commissioning phase. The transmitter output power was set to 1.5 watts during 
acquisition could have be switched up to 5 Watts.<BR>
<P>The antenna system consisted of a single VHF blade mounted on the earth 
facing facet surrounded by four UHF monopoles phased so as to provide a single 
"fat monopole" radiation pattern. The configuration can be seen in <I>figure 
2.<BR></I>
<P>Each UHF monopole presented an impedance of approximately 28 which had to be 
matched to the 50 transmitter output impedance. His was carried out by using a 
number of three quarter wavelength sections of 75 semi-rigid cable (see 
<I>figure 3</I>)<BR>
<P><IMG 
src="A Possible Explaination for the Failure of UoSAT-4_files/img00003.gif"><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>
<P><IMG 
src="A Possible Explaination for the Failure of UoSAT-4_files/img00004.gif"> 
<P>The physical structure of the antenna block was realised by attaching the 
inner of the cable via a strain relief loop to a pair of solder tags that were 
in turn screwed to the nickel plated steel blades. These in turn were supported 
by a PTFE block. The blades had to be removed and refitted several times during 
testing leaving the inner unsupported. The coaxial inner had a diameter of only 
0.3 mm and in fact one length of coaxial line had failed and been replaced prior 
to fitting the satellite to the rocket.<BR>
<P>Whilst this method successfully transformed all of the individual antenna 
impedance's to 50 , consider what happens when any one of the antennas becomes 
open circuit. The open circuit would be transformed to a short circuit at the 
transmitter output and the antenna system would be disabled. The effect of this 
would be to present the transmitter output with a sever mismatch. This had been 
known to produce transmitter oscillations at the test stage. Thus, the total 
effect of this fault would have been to prevent transmission of the signal and 
in addition throw the output signal off frequency. Therefore, even if efforts 
had been made to detect very low, leakage level signals on the published output 
frequencies the chances are that they would fail as transmission would have been 
at a spurious frequency.<BR>
<P><IMG 
src="A Possible Explaination for the Failure of UoSAT-4_files/Img00005.gif"> 
<P>
<P>So what were the lessons learnt from this? In later satellites the antenna 
transformation was achieved in two stages as shown in <I>figure 5</I>. In this 
case the loss of any single blade no longer caused the loss of the entire 
system. An analysis of the circuit showed that the return loss of the antenna 
system would typically fall from approximately 15 dB to 9 dB. The method of 
attaching the coaxial inner to the blades was also revised. In the new system 
the inner is connected to a plate which is then permanently 
<P>fitted behind a support block. In this case there is only ever one connection 
made and the inner is never left unsupported.<BR>
<P><B><FONT size=5>The Transmit Filter<BR></FONT></B>
<P>Early versions of the UoSAT range of satellites were not fitted with transmit 
filters. However, it had been observed that it was possible for the transmitter 
to cause de-sensitisation of the receiver. For this mission the object of the 
filter was two fold:- <BR>
<OL>
  <LI>to ensure that VHF noise produced by the UHF transmitter was reduced as 
  much as possible. 
  <LI>to reduce any interference from the transmitter with the DORIS receiver 
  system fitted to SPOT-2, the main payload of the Ariane mission. DORIS 
  (<B>D</B>etermination <B>O</B>rbite <B>R</B>adiopositionnement <B>I</B>ntegres 
  <B>S</B>atellite) was a CNES developed one way tracking system for the 
  measurement of precision orbits. The system was based on the reception of two 
  beacon frequencies of approximately 2 GHz and 401 MHz. With this system orbit 
  determination to within 20 cm were supposed to be possible. </LI></OL>
<P><IMG 
src="A Possible Explaination for the Failure of UoSAT-4_files/Img00006.gif"><BR>
<P>At this stage it was not possible to establish analytically exactly how much 
UHF rejection was required by the receiver so an engineering figure of 70 dB's 
was arrived at. The filter had to be developed within three days so an 
adaptation of a radio amateur helical filter was used. This comprised of two 
cavities each containing a small helical transmission line (see <I>figures 6 
&amp; 7</I>). Coupling between the two halves occurred via probe wires and 
tuning by adjustment screws. The inner coils were made resistant to vibration 
damage by adding a very small amount of low loss potting compound. <BR>
<P><IMG 
src="A Possible Explaination for the Failure of UoSAT-4_files/Img00007.gif"> 
<P>The frequency response of the helical filter was excellent it had an 
insertion loss of only 0.25 dB and no problems were found during terrestrial 
tests. However, in the flight model of the satellite it was not possible to test 
the complete transmitter system in the thermal vacuum chamber. Instead, for 
practical reasons, the output had to be taken directly from the transmitter 
output but before the filter and antennas. The result of this was that the 
characteristic of the filter under partial and full vacuum conditions was not 
tested under operational power conditions. It was always known that the filter 
would experience high voltages due to the Q of the circuit, certainly voltages 
in excess of one kilovolt could be experienced under high power conditions. 
Recent tests at SSTL have shown that during the early part of the mission when 
the air within the filter was escaping it was possible for corona discharge to 
occur. This discharge was due to the existence of high voltages in low pressure 
gases. The effect of this was to form a "flame" inside the filter that gradually 
stripped the metal from the coil and probe wires and deposited them on the 
filter wall. This effect was accompanied by an increase in return loss and 
eventually total failure of the filter. This effect has been duplicated in the 
laboratory.<BR>
<P>A poor match presented to the output of the amplifier chain would have had 
the same effect as a missing antenna blade, as described earlier, and one would 
expect the transmitter to have become unstable and the output frequency to have 
changed.<BR>
<P>The likelihood of corona discharge can be reduced by :-<BR>
<OL>
  <LI>Allowing the air to escape faster 
  <LI>Ensuring all surfaces are as smooth as possible. 
  <LI>Removing the probe wire and replacing them with a coupling aperture. 
  <LI>Replacing the tuning screws with variable high voltage vacuum capacitors. 
  <LI>Refrain from applying power to the transmitters for as long as possible so 
  as to allow longer for the air to escape. </LI></OL>
<P>
<P>Later models of the satellites had all of these recommendations implemented. 
Future satellites will have the helical filters replaced with an alternative 
arrangement. This has been made possible by further testing which has shown that 
the VHF rejection set for UoSAT-4 was in fact higher than necessary. Typically 
only 50 dB's of rejection are actually required rather than the 70 dB's 
previously set. An additional modification will be the inclusion of one filter 
per transmitter chain, once again reducing the number of single point failures 
in the system.<BR>
<P><B><FONT size=5>Lessons Learnt<BR></FONT></B>
<P>Though painful at the time of its loss UoSAT-4 provided valuable lessons in 
satellite design. Fault tolerance is being designed into both electronic and 
mechanical systems. All systems are now examined for single point failures and 
system design changed ,if possible, to avoid them.<BR>
<P>It is also worth remembering that UoSAT-3 has now been in orbit for 6 years 
and has carried out over thirty three thousand orbits! <BR>
