<P align=justify>Abstract</U>:</B><I> </I>The Centre for Satellite Engineering 
Research (CSER) and Surrey Satellite Technology Limited (SSTL) working together 
have established themselves as pioneers in low cost small satellite technology. 
One of the biggest challenges of reducing the high cost of space missions is 
maintaining high reliability. Research undertaken at CSER has shown that there 
is currently no suitable method for predicting the reliability of electronic 
systems on-board modern cost-effective small satellites. This research also 
revealed that it can be very difficult to improve existing methods or develop a 
new methodology which could be used practically for this purpose. However, it 
was found that the quality and consequently reliability of modern electronic 
components is currently very high. Furthermore, if the "top-down" approach to 
design, as well as current reliability improvement techniques and tools, are 
used appropriately in the design an electronic system, then it is very unlikely 
that such a system will fail. </P>

<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify>Because of the high cost involved in space missions, all 
customers in the space industry want to know how much risk is involved with a 
new product before purchasing it. For this reason, there is great need for a 
methodical way to accurately predict the reliability of spacecraft. This problem 
has been a fundamental issue in the space industry since the early 1950s. 
Dealing exclusively with electronic hardware reliability, research was 
undertaken at CSER to establish a methodology for: </P>

<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify>System reliability prediction begins by developing a 
reliability block diagram (model) of the system. The reliability model takes 
into consideration the amount of redundancy built into the system. The basic 
input into this model is the reliability value of the system’s components. Two 
approaches for predicting the reliability of electronic components were 
identified: an empirical based prediction methodology (e.g. MIL-HDBK-217) and a 
science based (theoretical) approach known as the Physics-of-Failure (PoF) 
approach. </P></FONT><FONT size=5>

<P align=justify>Section 3 of this paper presents the characteristics of a 
typical UoSAT (University of Surrey Satellite) spacecraft. Sections 4 and 5 
describe MIL-HDBK-217 method and the physics-of-failure approach respectively. 
Section 6 discusses the application of MIL-HDBK-217 and PoF approach to small 
modern low cost spacecraft. It also outlines recommendations of how more 
reliable systems could be realised. Section 7 present tools and techniques that 
can be used to implement these recommendations followed by a conclusion in 
section 8.</P>

  on-board solid state high capacity memory devices for data storage. Most of

<P align=justify>MIL-HDBK-217 (Military Handbook, Reliability Prediction of 
Electronic Equipment)<SUP>3</SUP>, is the most widely used tool for predicting 
component reliability. The first version of the handbook (MIL-HDBK-217A) was 
published in 1965, followed by updated versions in subsequent years to reflect 
the change in technology. MIL-HDBK-217F is the latest version. The content of 
MIL-217F includes failure rate models for nineteen major electronic component 
categories used in modern systems, ranging from microcircuits and discrete 
semiconductors to passive components such as resistors and capacitors. Models 
are developed by fitting curves to historical failure data from field operation 
or from laboratory tests. The handbook contains two methods for performing 
component reliability prediction, the<B> <I>parts count</B></I> and<B> <I>parts 
stress</I> </B>methods<SUP>4</SUP>. </P>
<P align=justify></P>

<P align=justify>Models for other parts differ slightly in both the form and 
input parameters of the above example. </P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify>The parts count method is meant to be applied early in the 
design process. Models for this method are obtained from Parts Stress models by 
assigning default values to some of the parameters which cannot be determined in 
the early design stages. For example, this implies assigning values for <FONT

above<SUP>4</SUP>.</P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify>Unfortunately, MIL-HDBK-217 models have been highly criticised, 
and some critics have even called for its elimination. Examples of issues that 
have been raised against the handbook models include:</P>
<UL>
  <P align=justify>
  <LI>The models do not address all the possible causes of 
  failure<SUP>5,6</SUP>. They assume that fundamental part design is perfect and 
  that failures are caused only by manufacturing defects which are accelerated 
  by operational stresses.
  <P></P>
  <P align=justify></P>
  <LI>The reliability of any electronic equipment depends on how it is designed, 
  manufactured, stored, transported and used. All these processes vary from 
  company to company and as such introduce large variability in the data 
  collected from different companies. This variability is not accounted for in 
  MIL-HDBK-217 models<SUP>7</SUP>. 
  <P></P>
  <P align=justify></P>
  <LI>It is possible that the failure data is affected by external failure 
  mechanisms and flawed reporting techniques. Consequently, there is no 
  statistical confidence associated with results obtained using the 
  models<SUP>8</SUP>. 
  <P></P>
  <P align=justify></P>
  <LI>Since MIL-HDBK-217 models are empirically derived, they do not identify 
  the actual origin of failures and therefore cannot be used for identifying 
  potential reliability problems. 
  <P></P>
  <P align=justify></P>
  <LI>The models are developed by assuming that the failure rate of components 
  is constant<SUP>9</SUP>. This implies that the reliability of a component is 
  independent of its age. Although this assumption is made on the basis that 
  equipment will start its mission after the early failures have been eliminated 
  and completes the mission before wear-out sets in (as described by the 
  bath-tube curve), experience has proved otherwise.
  <P></P>
  <P align=justify></P>
  <LI>The handbook also assumes that failure rate and reliability are related by 
  the Arrhenius relationship. That is, the tendency for the component to fail 
  increases with temperature. Evidence has also suggested 
  otherwise<SUP>7,10</SUP>. 
  <P></P>
  <P align=justify></P>
  <LI>Most of the models are reported to be out of date and are therefore not 
  applicable for state-of-the-art components<SUP>11</SUP>.
  <P></P>
  <P align=justify></P>
  <LI>Finally, where enough data is not available, models are obtained by 
  extrapolating from available data. The results obtained in such situations 
  have been described by some authors as educated guesses<SUP>12</SUP>. 
  <P></P></LI></UL>
<P align=justify></P>
<DIR>
<P align=justify>The lack of data is a growing problem as the reliability of 
components continue to increase (Figure-2). With the modern production 
techniques available today, the mean time between failure (MTBF) for components 
is currently very high<SUP>13</SUP>. It is necessary to test thousand of 
components for months and possibly years to obtain sufficient data to develop 
accurate empirical models. It is forecast that, at the turn of the century, tens 
of thousands of components will be tested at accelerated conditions for many 
weeks with no failures occurring<SUP>14</SUP>. Lack of data is in fact an 
"acute" problem as far as empirical models are concerned.</P>

<P align=justify>Despite these weaknesses, MIL-HDBK-217 is still the most widely 
used tool for making reliability predictions for complex electronic systems and 
for comparing design options. This is mainly because the handbook models are the 
only models that are available, and are well documented and easy to use for 
making reliability predictions. Software packages facilitating their application 
to complex systems are even available. Manufacturers of spacecraft and other 
complex electronic systems therefore have no choice but to use MIL-HDBK-217 when 
reliability analysis is requested by the customer. Other empirical reliability 
prediction handbooks exist but similar controversies surrounds them<SUP>15, 
16,17</SUP>. </P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify>According to Jensen<SUP>14</SUP>, "Achieving high reliability 
is a process of sound design and manufacturing practices. Using handbook 
predictions for design comparisons is rarely a good idea". It can mislead the 
designer to select a less reliable component over a more reliable one due to the 
lack of coherence between predicted values. Table-1 illustrates this point with 
predictions for a commercial-grade, plastic, 64K DRAM under the same 
environmental conditions, using empirical based models from different handbooks. 
</P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify>In general, empirical models have become inaccurate due to 
insufficient statistics on the failure of components. Critics of empirical 
models prefer the science based method known as the physics-of-failure (PoF) 
approach<SUP>20</SUP>.</P>

<P align=justify>Cushing et al<SUP>19</SUP>, defined this as an approach to 
design, reliability assessment, testing, screening and stress margins that uses 
knowledge of root-cause failure processes to prevent product failures through 
rigorous design and manufacturing practices. To apply it, the following steps 
are taken:</P>
<UL>
  <P align=justify>

  <LI>Develop a model for each failure mechanism through established principles

  failure site, manufacturing flaws, defects and environmental and operating 
  loads.
  <P></P>
  <P align=justify></P>
  <LI>Analyse all potential failure mechanisms at each failure site and

  <P></P>
  <P align=justify></P>
  <LI>The validation of each failure mechanism can only be done through

  <LI>It requires a lot of expertise and machinery to conduct the necessary

  <LI>Models are currently not available for all categories of electronic

  <P></P></LI></UL>
<P align=justify>However, there are many advantages to this approach, although 
most of them are of benefit to manufacturers of particular 
devices<SUP>4,18,20</SUP>. Some of these include:</P>
<UL>
  <P align=justify>
  <LI>Since PoF approach explicitly address the parameters which are found to 
  strongly influence component reliability (material properties, electrical, 
  thermal, mechanical and chemical stresses), it is a useful tool for designing 
  components.
  <P></P>

  <P align=justify></P>
  <LI>By identifying and modelling potential failure mechanisms, it provides

<P align=justify>Despite these advantages, it is still reasonable to conclude

  <P align=center>
  <LI>Conclusions on Component Reliability Prediction Methods
  <P></P></LI></OL></B></U></FONT><FONT size=3>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify>Firstly, since empirical models are inaccurate, they cannot be 
used to compare alternative designs reliably. Unfortunately, it is difficult to 
improve the accuracy of these models since the reliability of components 
continues to increase and technology changes rapidly. Secondly, the PoF approach 
is very complex and models do not currently exist for all classes of components. 
It is therefore impractical for application to the whole spacecraft. </P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify>From this knowledge, we believe that neither of these methods 
are suitable for predicting the reliability of modern components and hence the 
reliability of electronic sub-systems on modern low cost spacecraft. 
Consequently, reliability prediction is an ineffective method for comparing 
alternative designs of modern electronic systems. Experienced from the design, 
manufacture and operation of 11 microsatellites by CSER and SSTL have identified 
the "top down" approach defined by O’Connor<SUP>21</SUP> as a better method of 
achieving higher reliability in electronic systems. Using the ‘top down’ 
approach (from system to component level) together with engineering judgement, 
critical areas (weaknesses) in a design could be identified and weighting 
factors assigned to them. These weighting factors can be used as a basis for 
comparing alternative designs. Example of critical areas include:</P>
<UL>
  <P align=justify>
  <LI>single point failures,
  <P></P>
  <P align=justify></P>
  <LI>areas in which design changes have been implemented,
  <P></P>
  <P align=justify></P>
  <LI>areas where new components or non-space qualified parts have been used.
  <P></P></LI></UL>
<P align=justify>To further improve the design, reliability improvement 
techniques could then be applied to these areas, lessening the probability of 
the system failing.</P>

  <P align=center>
  <LI>Reliability Improvement Techniques
  <P></P></B></U></FONT><FONT size=3>
  <P align=justify></P>
  <P align=justify>Reliability improvement techniques include techniques of 
  fault prevention and fault tolerance (Figure-3)<SUP>22,23</SUP>. Fault 
  prevention is the traditional approach for increasing the reliability of a 
  system. In involves ensuring that all possible causes of unreliability have 
  been removed from the system before it is put to service. This can be achieved 
  using two basic techniques, fault avoidance and fault removal. </P>
  <P align=justify></P>
  <P align=justify>Fault avoidance is concerned with the use of design and 
  manufacturing methodologies aimed to avoid the introduction of faults into a 
  system. Fault removal is concerned with checking the completed system design 
  and removing any faults that are found<SUP>22</SUP>. Examples of tools which 
  can be used for this purpose include FMECA (Failure Mode Effect and 
  Criticality Analysis), FTA (Fault Tree Analysis) and SCA (Sneak Circuit 
  Analysis)<SUP>13</SUP>.</P>
  <P align=justify></P>
  <P align=justify>Since unexpected failures may still occur in a system, fault 
  tolerance (redundancy) techniques can be used to make a design more robust. 
  That is, being able to operate successfully with the failure of some of its 
  parts. Two main redundancy techniques were identified: active redundancy and

<P align=justify>This research has shown that none of the methods currently 
available is suitable for accurately predicting the reliability of 
state-of-the-art electronic components and hence the reliability of electronic 
sub-systems on modern small cost-effective spacecraft. Since technology is 
rapidly changing, modern production techniques have resulted in extremely low 
statistics of failure in electronic components. As a result, empirical 
reliability prediction models (e.g. MIL-HDBK-217) which are widely used have 
become inaccurate. Attempting to improve existing models or develop new ones is 
practically impossible considering the time and cost constraints associated with 
low cost missions. The alternative theoretical based physics-of-failure approach 
tends to be very complex and time consuming when applied to complex systems. It 
was found, however that higher system reliability can be realised using the "top 
down" approach to design together with engineering judgement to identify and 
weigh critical areas. Alternative designs could then be compared on the basis of 
the number of critical areas and their weighting factors. To further reduce the 
chances of failure, reliability improvement techniques are implemented in these 
critical areas. </P></FONT><FONT size=4>
