The Centre for Satellite Engineering Research (CSER) and Surrey Satellite Technology Limited (SSTL) working together have established themselves as pioneers in low cost small satellite technology. One of the biggest challenges of reducing the high cost of space missions is maintaining high reliability. Research undertaken at CSER has shown that there is currently no suitable method for predicting the reliability of electronic systems on-board modern cost-effective small satellites. This research also revealed that it can be very difficult to improve existing methods or develop a new methodology which could be used practically for this purpose.<br>

The following analysis is a total dose versus shielding curve for Emerald, assuming an orbit of 400km at an inclination of 56 degrees. It plots total dose accumulated by silicon for a year as a function of aluminum shielding thickness. 
 
Most COTS parts fail at around 5-10krads of radiation.  So from the curve, 100mils of Al will protect most parts for a year while allowing only about 1krads of radiation to comethrough during a year.  Solar panels and honeycomb should give this amount of shielding. <br>

<br></a>
The current method for predicting the observable single event upset (SEU) induced error rate in microprocessors operating in spacecraft ignore the influence of software, giving a pessimistic view of the observable SEU induced error rate at the system level by the device. To take the influence of software into consideration, the duty cycle for each register as the microprocessor executes software must be determined. Using a microprocessor simulator, a new methodology for determining the duty cycle of each register has been developed and is presented in this paper. Also, Monte Carlo type simulations have been performed to determine the nature of errors observed at system level from SEUs occurring inside a microprocessor. The algorithm is also presented here. The 8051 microprocessor and real satellite application software were used as examples in this study.<br>

<br></a>
State-of-the-art commercial microprocessors are attractive for use in cost effective space missions because, they are readily available, they are of high packaging density, cheap and capable of supporting extensive software. However, because they are not radiation hardened, they are susceptible to single event upset (SEU) caused by ionising radiation. Being able to predict ,in advance, the observable SEU induced error rate in a microprocessor is therefore essential. Using the 8051 processor as an example, a new method has being developed for this purpose and is presented here.<br>

Abstract
We describe an application of the RS code to the
routine error protection of large RAM memory for
satellites in low Earth orbit. Errors are normal in this
environment - an estimated 1000 soft errors per day for
128 Mbytes of memory being typical. There is a need to
free up the CPU from most or all of the required
encoding and decoding, and use a dedicated codec. The
device is mostly transparent to the routine transfer of
data between CPU and RAM disc Our choice of codec
uses FPGA technology. The application requires
correction of a maximum of two (byte) errors per block
of 512 bytes of data. This limited number of
corrections obviates the need for standard decoding
methods. A form of direct decoding is adopted that
allows very considerable simplification of the codec
with a low internal clock rate and low physical
complexity<br>

Today’s small satellites employ powerful
microcircuits to control virtually every
aspect of the spacecraft. While these small
devices are very capable, they are
increasingly vulnerable to heavy ion induced
Single Event Upset (SEU). Current
technology is not very susceptible to SEUs.
The evolution of microdevices is toward lower
power and higher speed while spacecraft
evolve toward smaller and lighter structures.
This combination, along with the increased
heavy ion particle fluence associated with
large solar flares, will cause tomorrow’s
microdevices to experience SEU at rates
approaching 100 upsets per device per day!
To ensure mission success, these small
satellites must consider implementing one or
more SEU mitigation techniques.<br>

The onboard computer is necessary in the satellite in order to provide services needed by the other
parts of the satellite. It is the plan to have all software loaded in the onboard computer memory and
use the processor I/O ports to give commands/retrieve information from all other parts. The
computer will be constructed on a single board that will constitute one layer of the internal of the
satellite.<br>
Interface<br>
Our idea is to make a socket on each layer that connects all layers in the satellite. This socket could
contain all I/O ports from the processor, different power lines etc. Then each group/layer would
have specific ports assigned depending on their needs. We believe this way of doing it will be easier
than designing the system with a bus. A bus would complexify the design and if one part should
hang there would be danger of this part blocking the entire system.<br>

The lunar mission is to be Surrey
Satellite Technology first step to
interplanetary travel. SSTL has designed,
built and launched twelve low cost
microsatellites into LEO, starting in
1981 with UoSAT-1. Design of the next
generation of low cost spacecraft, (250-400 Kg) is well underway, with UoSAT-12.
This spacecraft is the first in a series
of missions planned to qualify SSTL’s
minisatellite technology and to pave the
way for the low cost lunar orbiter. The
primary objective of this technology
demonstration exercise is to show that
low cost interplanetary missions are
possible and to validate the minisatellite
bus. In keeping with the low cost
approach, it is intended that the lunar
mission project cost including launch
shall not exceed $15M. This paper
discusses how we intend to meet the cost
challenge by applying our current low
cost practices augmented with
autonomy. Spacecraft autonomy will be
described specifically in relation to the
orbit determination and control sub-system.<br>

technology investments and minimizing
customer management oversight, significant
reductions in cost and schedule could be
realized, while advancing the state of the art in
spacecraft performance. Use of the latest in
sensor, processor, and structures technology
enabled the SSTI Lewis Guidance, Navigation

its pointing capabilities over most lightsat
programs. The combination of vastly reduced
customer oversight, extensive subsystem
heritage from previous programs, and the
flexibility to use in-house, high reliability design
and testing practices allowed the subsystem to
complete under the original budget, and in less
than two years. Compared with other high
quality lightsats, the SSTI Lewis GNCS has
superior performance, was completed in less
time, cost less to produce, and is of equal or
higher quality.<br>

A single-board computer system
created specifically to meet the demands of a
new generation of small satellite missions is
being designed, built and tested by students
at the University of New Hampshire. The
Satellite Single-Board Computer (SSBC) is
an Intel 80C186 based system that is
qualified for explicit use in low-earth orbit
missions. The SSBC serves as a low-cost,
high-c~uality alternative to commercially
available systems which are usually very
costly and designed for much harsher space
environments. These "off-the-shelf" systems
are normally out of price range for most very
low-cost satellite projects. At the other end of
the spectrum, however, are inexpensive
commercial-quality computer boards that do
not offer any space-hardened characteristics.
These systems are typically not designed to
survive the cosmic radiation and extreme
temperature levels usually found in low-earth
orbit. The SSBC fills in the gap between these two alternatives.<br>

This project is part of the DTUsat project, which involves more than 50
students at the Technical University of Denmark.
The satellite is based on the CubeSat concept, which has been developed by
students and professors at the American University, Stanford. The concept
is to make a small satellite in a standard form. The size of the CubeSat is
10x10x10 cm, and it has a maximum weight of 1 kg. Bundles of CubeSats
can be sent in orbit together, instead of being sent individually, resulting in
a signi½cant reduction of launch costs.<br>
The onboard software is part of the satellite platform and provides basic
services for the payload and the other subsystems on the satellite. Those
services include:Communication, Scheduling, Housekeeping, Autonomy.<br>
This report includes a detailed description of each onboard software module,
including an overview of the module design, a description of the module's
responsibilities and which commands the module handles.<br>

This document describes how the software running on the onboard computer of a
satellite could be organized and which services it should provide.
Further more it is described how the different subsystems of the satellite are
represented.
The issues covered include:<br>
Basic organization and representation of subsystems<br>
Inter-process communication<br>
Storage management<br>
Prioritising of downlink communication<br>
Scheduling<br>
Collection of housekeeping data<br>
Process priorities & time critical components<br>
The proposed software model is very much inspired from the one used on the Orsted
satellite, it is very modularised and flexible approach that allows parallel development
on the different subsystems.<br>
The proposed packet format is also inspired from the one used on Ørsted, which is a
subset of the ESA – Packet utilisation standard.<br>

November 8, 2002<br></a>
This document is documentation of the software written for the On Board Computer (OBC) on the AAU-cubesat.
Since the software has been written by many people organized in different groups and since the
development has been ongoing for long time there exists no single complete source of documentation of the
software. This document try to give an overview of the software by describing structure, threads, functions
and datatypes. But many things are not described in this document and must be found in the documentation
from the specific group responsible for a specific piece of software.

Object Oriented Design W. Mark Reid)<br></a>
This paper
describes the object-oriented design (OOD) of the SMEX-Lite Attitude Control System (ACS)
software. The SMEX-Lite ACS is three-axis controlled and is capable of performing sub-arc-minute
pointing. This paper first describes high level requirements governing the SMEX-Lite ACS
software architecture. Next, the context in which the software resides is explained. The paper
describes the principles of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism with respect to the
implementation of an ACS software system. This paper will also discuss the design of several
ACS software components. Specifically, object-oriented designs are presented for sensor data
processing, attitude determination, attitude control, and failure detection. Finally, this paper will
address the establishment of the ACS Foundation Class (AFC) Library. The AFC is a large
software repository, requiring a minimal amount of code modifications to produce ACS software
for future projects.<br>

Control Test and Flight Code
Mark Andrew Salada, Associate Staff<br></a>
This paper describes the use of a
commercial product, MathWorks’ RealTime
Workshopâ (RTW), to generate actual
flight code for NASA’s Thermosphere,
Ionosphere, Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics
(TIMED) mission. The Johns Hopkins
University Applied Physics Laboratory
is handling the design and construction of
this satellite for NASA. As TIMED is scheduled
to launch in May of the year 2000,
software development for both ground and
flight systems are well on their way. However,
based on experience from previous
APL missions such as Midcourse Space Experiment
(MSX) and the Near Earth Asteroid
Rendezvous (NEAR), the designers of
the attitude estimation and control system
desire a more streamlined approach for analysts
to incorporate their algorithms into
flight code. Specifically, the attitude control
designers want an easier and quicker iteration
capability during integration and test
that somehow includes their principle development
environment, Simulinkâ. One of the
problems is that complete attitude simulations
in the Simulink models include both
flight and non-flight elements. (...)<br>

Planning and Scheduling for Autonomous Small Satellite<br></a>
This paper presents an architecture which is
developed using rules-based Fuzzy Expert System(FES). Fuzzy expert systems not only maintains
the value of based rules and the merit of using fuzzy logic control to describe uncertainty systems,
and utilizes the predominance of using expert systems to denote and control knowledge. In order to
adapt the requirement of onboard operation, the resource restrain is considered in the architecture,
such as processing speed of CPU, the capacity of storage and the real-time requirement.
As the application of this architecture, this paper also describes an onboard automated planning
and scheduling system in the SMMS, which is a small satellite of Research Institute of Satellite
Engineering and Technology of Harbin Institute of Technology and will be launched in 2000.

Observing-1 Spacecraft
Kathie Blackman and Jeff D’Agostino<br></a>
The Earth Observing 1 (EO-1) mission is part of NASA’s New Millennium Program (NMP). The EO-1
Attitude Control System (ACS) flight software was based on the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM)
flight software, both of which were developed by the Hammers Company, Inc. Lessons learned during TRMM
ACS software development led to a consolidated software development approach for the EO-1 ACS.
The approach started with a standalone system that incorporated the “first-cut” flight software into the spacecraft
simulation, allowing closed loop simulations to run on a desktop computer. Consequently, more algorithm and
coding errors were detected earlier in the development process. The consolidated system was connected directly to
a ground support equipment computer in order to develop test procedures, ground system databases, and display
pages. For flight software testing, the system’s spacecraft simulation module was used as a spacecraft simulator,
and the flight software was removed and loaded onto the test or flight hardware.<br>

The increasing operational requirements for onboard autonomy in satellite control systems necessitates
structural methods that support the design of a complete and reliable supervisory system. This paper presents
the design strategy used to develop a supervisor for the attitude control system for the Danish Ørsted satellite.
The main topic is handling of faults arising in onboard instrumentation, ie. how to detect faults and how to
prevent propagation into failures with potential mission loss as a consequence. Formal methods are used to
ensure complete coverage of all potential fault types and to guarantee that the design criteria are met in the
final implementation.<br>

OPEN PROBLEMS<br></a>
In this paper we provide some new results for the problem of the attitude stabilization of a non-symmetric
rigid body spacecraft using two pairs of gas jet actuators. We propose both time-invariant and time-varying
discontinuous stabilizing control laws. We emphasize the problem of feasible trajectory generation for an
underactuated spacecraft and we provide a solution to this problem using ideas from the theory of differentially
flat systems. Numerical simulations accompany the theoretical developments. We also provide some
discussion on open problems in this framework. It turns out that these control problems are significant not
only because of their use in applications but also because of their challenging theoretical aspects.<br>
