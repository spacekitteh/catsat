USING CCD LINEAR ARRAY<br></a>
A motivation to the development of the wide angle Digital Slit Sun Sensor, its main features and technical description are described in this article. The figures of the sensor, troubleshooting encountered during its development, and measured characteristics are presented as well. The difficulties in designing of very wide angle Sun sensor are discussed. It is shown, that if one is interested primary in the accuracy, it is better to construct the sensor with the field of view less then 90 ∞ (± 45∞ ).<br>

DEVELOPEMENT IN THE INSTITUTE OF ATMOSPHERIC
PHYSICS, PRAGUE, CZECH REPUBLIC<br></a>
Coming from the experience of the design and construction of the onboard-instruments of
Czech satellites MAGION 1 to 5, (MAGION 5 is still working) the Institute of Atmospheric
Physics is developing a new version of several sensors and electronic systems. The overview
and main features of the following sensors and instruments are presented. <br>

This paper presents an overview of how inertial sensor
technology is applied in current applications, and how it is
expected to be applied in near- and far-term applications.
The ongoing trends in inertial sensor technology develop-ment
are discussed, namely interferometric fiber-optic
gyros, micromechanical gyros and accelerometers, and
micro-optical sensors. Micromechanical sensors and
improved fiber-optic gyros are expected to replace many
of the current systems using ring laser gyroscopes or
mechanical sensors. The successful introduction of the
new technologies is primarily driven by cost, and cost
projections for systems using these new technologies are
presented. Externally aiding the inertial navigation system
(INS) with the global positioning system (GPS) has opened
up the ability to navigate a wide variety of new, large-vol-ume
applications, such as guided artillery shells. These
new applications are driving the need for extremely low-cost,
batch-producible sensors.<br>

A new precision sun sensor, called DIGITAL SUN SENSOR (DSS), which uses no optics to sense the
sun angle in two axes, has been developed by Officine Galileo Space B.U. It has a large dynamic
range and thus combines the functions traditionally performed by separate fine and coarse sensors
in order to cover a wide range of applications. It finds use on Commercial, Earth Observation and
Scientific satellites during transfer orbit manoeuvres as well as for on station operations. This sun
sensor provides medium/high accuracy, wide field of view, high reliability, radiation tolerance,
small size, and low mass, all of which are important for use in ACS of small satellites.<br>
