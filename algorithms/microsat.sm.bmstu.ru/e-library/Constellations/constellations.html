A non-standard approach solves several problems
encountered in the production of commercial
constellations consisting of relatively large
numbers of spacecraft. In a commercial
environment, market pressures drive the need for a
rapid production schedule and highly reliable
satellites. This dictates a departure from a
conventional spacecraft production process.<br>

Orbit Micro-satellites<br></a>
In certain low Earth orbit (LEO)satellite missions it is required that two or more satellites
operate in a certain spacial configuration relative to each other. This paper introduces a
simple concept of utilising atmospheric drag, a natural phenomenon which is normally
considered as an unwanted disturbance, to achieve this type of constellation control. A
control strategy to illustrate the concept is proposed and tested through detailed computer
simulations, including the effects of a number of significant orbital perturbations. The
control time to reach a specified separation distance between two satellites is determined as a
function of certain critical parameters. These parameters include the physical properties of the
satellite, the orbital configuration and the state of the atmosphere.<br>

The low-cost constellation maintenance system
is described here, illustrating its range of functionality and its application to different
example constellations. The top-level system
architecture is presented, showing the relation
between the orbit control system and spacecraft
attitude control system. Autonomous orbit
control, the key system component which makes
autonomous constellation maintenance possible,
is also described. Simulation results are
presented for the case of two satellites in the
same orbit, separated by 10 sec in orbit phase.<br>

SPACECRAFT FORMATIONS</a><br>In this paper we introduce a new class of formations that maintain a constant shape as viewed from the Earth. We develop
an algorithm to place on spacecraft in a constant shape formation spaced equally in time using the classical orbital elements.
To first order the dimensions of the formation are shown to be
simple functions of orbit eccentricity and inclination. The performance of the formation is investigated over a Keplerian orbit
using a performance measure based on a weighted average of the
angular separations between spacecraft in formation. Analytic
approximations are developed that yield optimum con.gurations
for different values of n. The analytic approximations are shown
to be in excellent agreement with the exact solutions.

CAPABILITIES FOR LOCAL SATELLITE CLUSTERS</a><br>
This paper examines the propulsive requirements necessary to maintain the relative positions of satellites orbiting in
a local cluster. Formation of these large baseline arrays could allow high resolution imaging of terrestrial or astronomical targets using techniques similar to those used for decades in radio interferometry.<br>

This paper deals with the propulsion and
trajectory issues of creating a small satellite
constellation around the Sun. The possible uses
for such a constellation, including stereoscopic
imaging of the Sun and gamma ray burst
localization, are briefly discussed. The focus of
the paper is then narrowed to a range of orbits
and payload masses.<br>

Clusters of low-performance spacecraft flying in formation may provide enhanced performance over
single high-performance spacecraft. This is especially true for remote sensing missions where interferom-etry
or stereographic imaging may provide higher resolution data. The configuration of such formations
vary during an orbit due to orbital dynamics, and over larger time scales due to perturbations. Selection
of a configuration should be based on overall performance of the formation. In this paper, performance
measures are developed and evaluated based on integration over one orbit. The measures involve angular
separation of spacecraft, instantaneous overlap access area, and an area-based measure of the separation of
the spacecraft.<br>
