Orbital Transfer.<br></a>
Solar electric propulsion uses solar panels to generate power for electric thrusters. Using
stored energy makes it possible to thrust through eclipses, but requires that some of the
solar power collected during the sunlit portion of the trajectory be used to recharge the
storage system. Previous researchers have reported that the required energy storage
mass can be prohibitive. However, the use of high-speed flywheels for energy storage
can provide advantages. In this paper, we compare the effectiveness of orbit transfers
using and without using energy storage. The orbit transfers are developed as sequences
of time-optimal circle-to-circle planar transfers from low-Earth orbit to geostationary
orbit. We develop techniques for solving the appropriate boundary value problems,
and illustrate tradeoffs between solar array and ywheel-battery masses for transfers requiring multiple revolutions. The utility of flywheel energy storage specifcally for
the use of the solar electric propulsion system is examined. We find that when flywheel
energy storage is used in these scenarios, transit times are typically increased, but
significant propellant mass savings can be realized. Furthermore, if the spacecraft has
a requirement for energy storage, then it is advantageous to use stored energy during
the orbit transfer.<br>

This paper describes the progress associated with a joint effort to demonstrate an advanced pulsed plasma thruster (PPT) on MightySat
Flight II.1 to be launched in January, 1999. The PPT currently being developed for this flight represents a significant leap in
technology compared to previous flight models.<br>

EXPERIMENTS. AAS/AIAA Space Flight
Mechanics Meeting(Mark Campbell,University of Washington)<br></a>
The Ionospheric Observation Nanosatellite Formation (ION-F)
comprises three small spacecraft that will cooperate to make
measurements of the ionosphere’s electron density and its effects
on GPS signal propagation. A novel feature of the mission is the
planned suite of formation flying experiments involving the three
satellites. The uniqueness of these experiments is enhanced by the
dissimilar nature of the sensors and actuators used by the three
spacecraft, including micro-pulsed plasma thrusters, a
hydroxylammonium nitrate (HAN) monopropellant thruster, and
differential drag control. In this paper, we describe the ION-F
mission, the designs of the three satellites, and the proposed suite
of formation flying experiments.<br>

Pulsed Plasma Thrusters (PPTs) are finding renewed user appeal due to the growth in small satellite
applications. PPTs are especially well suited to small satellite applications because they are simple,
low-mass, and high Isp propulsion systems. The solid Teflon fuel allows for a self-contained, inert and
stable propellant system. With a power draw of only 0.1 to 150 W and a very small (50 - 800 µN-s)
impulse bit, PPT technology makes it possible to consider a revolutionary attitude control system
(ACS) concept providing stabilization and pointing accuracies previously obtainable only with reaction
wheels, with reduced mass and power requirements. NASA Lewis Research Center (LeRC) and Olin
Aerospace Company (OAC) are working together to develop an advanced PPT system with twice the
total impulse capability and half the mass of the previous best PPT system.<br>
