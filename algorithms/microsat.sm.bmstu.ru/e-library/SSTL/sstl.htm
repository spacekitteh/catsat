The SSTL-Weitzmann boom is a compact system for deploying
payloads or instruments, or to form the basis of a gravity gradient
attitude system, on a 6 metre rigid boom. The STACER tube, on
which it is based, has a heritage of over 25 years, during which more
than 600 units have been used on a variety of spacecraft and
sounding rockets.<br>

The SSTL EOS offers both wide angle multispectral and high resolution
panchromatic imaging from a single small satellite. The platform is
highly flexible and can be accommodated in a range of orbits as either a
single spacecraft or as part of a constellation. The spacecraft includes
features such as slewing, orbit control, extensive on-board memory and
near real time image transmission via X-band. SSTL can also offer
ground segment and launch services to form a complete turn-key
system.

The Disaster Monitoring Constellation is a novel international
partnership led by Surrey, comprising a network of five small
satellites and ground stations. DMC has individual space segment
owners, to jointly provide daily revisit to any point on the globe
through the consortium of owners. From a low Earth orbit, each
satellite offers 36 metre, multispectral imaging, over a 600 km swath
width. The constellation offers dynamic remote sensing services at
high temporal resolution. The consortium has agreed to donate 5%
of images to relief agencies via the Reuters Foundation Alertnet.<br>

The first implementation of SSTL’s Geostationary minisatellite, the
GEMINI mission, will result in the in-orbit service demonstration of a
low cost, commercial Geostationary communications minisatellite. The
GEMINI spacecraft carries four digital transponders and is designed to
provide reliable and accessible communications services for Nigeria
and West African Countries, for a contract cost less than f26 Million.<br>

The SSTL GEMINI (Geostationary Minisatellite) Direct Platform offers low
cost, Geostationary communications from a small satellite. The platform
can accommodate payloads up to 110 kg mass and 800 W power,
enabling provision of a diverse array of communications services. Key
features are autonomous orbit control, deployable arrays to provide
high specific payload power and autonomous operations - these enable
an excellent quality of service over the mission lifetime.<br>

The SSTL MicroSat-70 platform employs a flexible modular design
capable of supporting a wide range of missions in low Earth orbit.
The microsatellite combines a comprehensive range of flight-proven
technologies and demonstrated tailor-made services at a low cost.
These platforms have been applied to Earth Observation,
Communications and Technology Demonstration missions for civil
and military use. SSTL has designed, built, launched and operated
17 microsatellites. The microsatellites are operated in orbit from
SSTL’s own mission control centre at its facility.<br>

microsatellite missions. On-board propulsion and navigation,
combined with a design suited for series production, make the
platform ideal for constellations or ‘swarms’ of similar spacecraft.
Payload accommodation is made easy using simple standard
mechanical, electrical and data interfaces.<br>
