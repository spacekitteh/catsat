SATELLITES<br></a>
The paper presents the research results on possibility and efficiency of using the new
types of image receivers. At present the Earth observation space systems are usually
furnished with CCD (charge –coupled device) receivers of visible range with pixel 9
–12 _m and Cd-Hg-Te receivers in infrared range. The results of research show larger
efficiency of CCD receivers with smaller pixel and infrared receivers on indium
antimonide. The paper shows specific estimations of mass and informative benefits of
small satellites, furnished with receivers, proposed by Russian companies.<br>

A solar power satellite (SPS) is a
satellite dedicated to collecting solar energy
on orbit, transforming it into microwave or
laser energy, and beaming it to a receiving
station on the ground. The transmitted
energy is converted into DC or AC power for
consumer use. Even a test version of the
SPS would be a challenging and expensive
undertaking due to the amounts of energy
which need to be collected. Satellites
measured in hundreds of meters and
hundreds of millions of dollars are required
for an accurate demonstration. It has been
suggested that useful measurements can be
made for substantially less if the beaming
direction is reversed. A 30 kg, cubic satellite
with 31 cm square faces costing under two
million dollars is presented. The spacecraft is
to receive, rectify and measure microwave
power beamed from a high-power, ground-based
radar station. Secondary payload
opportunities have been analyzed in
conjunction with the applicability,
availability, and cost of government radar
stations. Primary and back-up radar stations
have been chosen. Orbital constraints
recommended the selection of respective
primary and back-up launch vehicles. The
satellite is being designed to survive the
launch environments of both launchers to
increase the likelihood of mission success.<br>

Abstract
Individual satellites have been measuring
the Earth’s magnetic field since 1958.
Measurements taken in this way have led
to some interesting discoveries about the
earth’s magnetosphere. However, they
have also raised many questions about the
magnetosphere’s finer texture and
dynamic nature. Researchers at JPL have
proposed a mission where a single larger
satellite ejects several picosatellites in
order to simultaneously sample a volume
of space. Each picosat is to carry a small,
two axis, fluxgate magnetometer, several
photo detectors for spin rate detection, a
micro processor and a high frequency
transmitter. After launch from the main
satellite, each picosat will transmit its
sensor readings back to the main satellite
where the data will be stored for retrieval.
Issues addressed in this paper are related
to the design, manufacture, and planned
flight test of the picosatellite on OPAL, a
Stanford University Student Spacecraft.

SYNTHESIS SYSTEM FOR SMALL SATELLITE<br></a>
The project of high-resolution synthetic aperture radar system designed for a small sat-ellite
is proposed. It is intended for expeditious producing of detailed radar images of
natural and artificial origin objects. The offered radar system has space resolution of 3
meters and four non-coherent accumulations (looks). The system key feature is, that
images synthesis and their normalization are carried out immediately on the satellite.
The obtained radar image is exposed to compression. These operations reduce volume of
data, transmitted on the ground by tens time. For a data acquisition the antenna of 1-m
diameter could be used. The survey is realized in telescope mode, and the result is pro-duced
by square frames of 10 ´ 10 kilometers. Weight of radar is about 100 kg, including
radar antenna and radio link equipment.<br>
