<H2>Introduction</H2>
<P>Over the past 15 years UoSAT and SSTL have developed, built and launched a 
number of low cost 50kg microsatellites. A number of these spacecraft are 
available for amateur radio operators to use, although many amateur stations do 
not know the inner workings of these spacecraft. This paper provides an overview 
of the microsatellite platform operation - both hardware and software, and 
concludes with an summary into the routine operations performed on the 
spacecraft from the UoSAT/SSTL command station. 
<H2>The UoSAT Microsatellite platform</H2>
<P>The UoSAT microsatellite platform is designed to provide a modular bus that 
could accommodate various missions with minimal changes to the platform. 
<H3>Structure</H3>
<P>All UoSAT spacecraft since UoSAT-3 have been based around a modular stacking 
arrangement where the electronic module boxes comprise the basic satellite 
structure. The 'stack' is held together with spiral pins, and the solar panels 
are fixed to the outside of the spacecraft. One end of the spacecraft carries 
the 6 meter gravity gradient boom, while the other comprises the Earth 
observation platform. 
<P>The microsatellite platform features

platform</CENTER>
<H3>Power System</H3>
<P>The power system comprises 4 solar panels supplying power to a 14V NiCad 
battery pack. The Battery Charge Regulator (BCR) and Power Conditioning Module 
(PCM) are dual redundant systems designed to eliminate single point failures. 
<H3>RF System</H3>
<P>The RF system comprises three VHF receivers and two UHF transmitters. The 
three receivers are connected to a single antenna with RX0 primarily used for 
command and is not connected via the low noise amplifier to reduce the 
possibility of failure and overloading. The transmitters include an array of 
modulators and the output multiplexers allow switching of many different audio 
sources onto the downlink, including different modems and audio loopback from 
the receivers. 
<H3>Attitude Determination and Control System</H3>
<P>The ADCS system includes dual magnetometers, sun sensors and earth horizon 
sensors, and a magnetorquer system for attitude control. The ADCS control task 
runs on the On Board Computer reading information from the various sensors and 
firing the magnetorquers as required to ensure the spacecraft remains earth 
pointing. The system is capable of maintaining off pointing to well within 5 
degrees. 
<P>The microsatellite spacecraft employ passive thermal control. This is 
achieved by the ADCS task spinning the spacecraft at approximately 0.6 degrees 
per second, or 10 minutes per revolution. This spinning maintains all sides of 
the spacecraft at approximately the same temperature, and failure of this would 
quickly result in a large temperature differential across the spacecraft of over 
100 degrees Celsius.

<H3>Telemetry and Telecommand System</H3>
<P>The TTC system comprises a dedicated command decoder module and telemetry 
module. These systems are normally controlled via the on-board computers, 
however if the OBC is not operational for any reason it is possible to directly 
command the spacecraft and receive telemetry. 
<P>The command module comprises four redundant decoders, one of which is 
permanently connected to RX0 while the others scan a number of different inputs 
thus providing redundant control paths. 
<P>The telemetry system includes two redundant custom VLSI chips specifically 
designed to miniaturise the telemetry channel selection and formatting 
functions. If the OBC is not operational, these chips are capable of providing a 
formatted telemetry transmission direct to the downlink. 
<H3>On Board Data Handling System</H3>
<P>The primary on-board computer to date has been the OBC186 which includes 
between 512K and 768K of Error Detection and Correction (EDAC) protected program 
memory, and is connected to a 16MB RAMDisk for data storage. The OBC is able to 
command the rest of the spacecraft and has a direct link to both the telemetry 
and command modules. 
<H2>OBC Software</H2>
<P>The OBC has a small bootloader program loaded in EPROM which allows the 
computer software to be loaded following a reset. The bootloader is a very small 
and simple program which is necessary to ensure that there are no bugs in this 
code which will prevent the OBC being loaded. The bootloader provides no 
function other than to facilitate reloading of the flight code into RAM. 
<P>The OBC186 computer runs a multitasking operating system called SCOS 
(<B>S</B>pace<B>C</B>raft <B>O</B>perating <B>S</B>ystem). SCOS provides many of 
the basic functions required for the computer to operate such as memory 
allocation and task switching, as well as interprocess communication streams to 
allow tasks to communicate with one another. The SCOS Kernel is loaded by the 
bootloader and once the Kernel is running, the rest of the flight code can be 
loaded. 
<P>The functions performed by the OBC is carried out by a number of individual 
tasks. Generally, tasks can be terminated and reloaded without having to 
completely reload the OBC which allows most software upgrades to be performed 
without any interruption to spacecraft users. 
<P>In general there are seven tasks that perform the basic functions required 
for the spacecraft to operate as a store and forward communications system. 
These tasks comprise the following -: 
<P><B>QAX25</B> QAX25 provides the low level AX25 packet radio protocol 
functions for the uplink and downlink. 
<P><B>Loader</B> The loader is responsible for interacting with the operating 
system to allow control stations to load new software into the computers memory. 

<P><B>TLM </B>The telemetry server provides an interface for other tasks 
operating on the OBC to communicate with the telemetry system on board the 
spacecraft. 
<P><B>Mfile</B> The file system provides a standard FAT type file system for 
accessing the RAMDisk with a single directory and a maximum of 800 files. Mfile 
can be restarted following a reload without loss of files on the spacecraft. 
<P><B>HIT </B>The Housekeeping Integration Task performs many of the basic 
housekeeping functions required for the spacecraft to operate safely. It gathers 
telemetry from the telemetry server and transmits it on the downlink or stores 
it as a Whole Orbit Data (WOD) survey. HIT provides the command link with the 
control station and is also capable of automatically running scheduled 
spacecraft events. 
<P><B>FTL0</B> FTL0 is the primary task responsible for servicing user requests. 
It performs the broadcast downlink service as well as connected mode uploading. 
Up to 20 stations at once can have requests queued for downloading while 2 
simultaneous uploads are taking place. FTL0 also performs the automatic deletion 
of old files in the RAMDisk to ensure that there is always at least 1MB of free 
memory and 50 free directory entries. 
<P><B>ADCS</B> The ADCS task controls the spin and attitude of the spacecraft. 
It calculates the spacecraft position using the keplerian elements uploaded from 
the command station each week, and uses the magnetometers to measure the Earth's 
magnetic field, and compares this against a model of the Earth's magnetic field 
to calculate the spacecraft pointing angle. This data is used to calculate 
magnetorquer firing times, and it is capable of maintaining the spacecraft 
attitude to within 5 degrees of nadir pointing. 
<P>In addition, spacecraft payloads will have a support task running on the OBC 
to allow the payload to interact with the rest of the spacecraft. For example, 
the imaging payload support task is TST (Transputer Support Task). It is 
responsible for facilitating the transfer of CCD image data to the RAMDisk and 
commands from the OBC to the transputer system which carries out the imaging. 
<P>The on board software is designed to respond to any anomalies by transmitting 
a message on the downlink that the groundstation software can automatically 
detect. In the case of a severe error that the OBC can not rectify, the software 
can cause a 'screech' which safes the spacecraft and places the OBC software 
back into the bootloader. Under these circumstances, the command station can 
perform a memory dump of the program memory and analyse this to ascertain the 
cause of the problem. 
<H2>Store and Forward System</H2>
<P>The arrangement of the flight software results in the ability to pass files 
or 'messages' through the spacecraft using the OBC RAMDisk for message storage. 
This is the store and forward communications system and most users only consider 
it as a way to send other users email type messages. However, the store and 
forward system is an integral part of the UoSAT spacecraft as it not only allows 
messages to be passed from one groundstation to another, but is also the basis 
for all operational data transfer to and from the spacecraft. When commanding 
the spacecraft, configuration information is loaded into the store and forward 
system, and a secure command program is used to tell the spacecraft which file 
contains the information. Likewise, spacecraft housekeeping information is 
placed into the store and forward system and downloaded in the same way as user 
messages. 
<H1>Surrey Mission Operations Centre</H1>
<P>Spacecraft operations is traditionally a very expensive business because it 
normally involves continuos monitoring of spacecraft by operations staff. 
However, in the low cost satellite industry, this is not practical as the 
overhead can quickly become an appreciable percentage of total mission costs. 
<P>At UoSAT, the autonomous operation of the spacecraft is complemented by 
automatic operations and monitoring at the Surrey Mission Operations Centre 
(SMOC). The SMOC is only manned during normal working hours five days per week. 
At other times the groundstation and spacecraft telemetry are monitored 
automatically, and if there are any anomalies, the operations team is notified 
automatically by a pager system. The nature of the problem is displayed on an 
alpha-numeric display and the operator can make a decision as to what action to 
take. This reduces the operations overhead while still providing continuos 
monitoring of operational systems. 
<H2>Commissioning Operations</H2>
<P>When the spacecraft is launched, only the receivers, power system and command 
system are active. During the first transits over the command station, the 
spacecraft is powered up and telemetry is received and analysed to ensure the 
spacecraft is healthy. Once this is complete, the OBC flight software is loaded 
and control of the spacecraft is given to the housekeeping software. 
<P>When the spacecraft is released from the launcher it's attitude is a random 
tumbling. During the first few days following launch the ADCS system slows the 
satellite and removes the Z axis tumbling. The gravity gradient boom can then be 
deployed and the ADCS algorithm ensures that the satellite attitude is 
'captured' earth pointing and locked. The algorithm can then automatically 
switch to delibration mode and the spacecraft is spun up to the nominal spin 
rate of one revolution every ten minutes. 
<H2>Routine Command Operations</H2>
<P>In low earth orbit (LEO), spacecraft are not in permanent view of a command 
station and therefore must be able to operate for extended periods of time 
without command station interaction. The UoSAT spacecraft operate autonomously 
in orbit and only require routine commanding to update configuration files. 
<P>The only routine operations requirement is for the ADCS system to be updated 
once per week with new keplerian data, and for the spacecraft schedule file to 
be loaded each month. These files are automatically prepared by the 
groundstation software and uploaded to the spacecraft. The operations staff need 
to use the secure command program to notify the spacecraft of the new 
configuration file. 
<P>The spacecraft time needs to be kept very accurate for the ADCS, and some 
payloads to perform correctly. The spacecraft is moving at approximately 7 &frac12; KM 
per second so if the time is not correct, the spacecraft position will be 
calculated incorrectly. The command station performs clock synchronisation with 
the satellite using a ground based GPS time standard and is capable of setting 
the time to within 10 ms. This ensures that the spacecraft clock is kept 
accurate to well within one second. 
<H1>Housekeeping Data</H1>
<P>The spacecraft transmits real time telemetry frames every five seconds. This 
telemetry is primarily useful for command purposes such that when a command is 
transmitted to the spacecraft, an immediate result can be observed. 
<P>Since this telemetry is only available while the spacecraft is in view of the 
groundstation, another means of collecting housekeeping data is required. This 
requirement is realised in the form of Whole Orbit Data surveys (WOD) and task 
log files where the data is stored on board the spacecraft in the file system 
and made available for download at the end of the day. These files are placed 
into the store and forward system and may be downloaded in exactly the same way 
as user traffic. 
<P>Of the primary tasks running on the spacecraft, the following log files are 
created: 
<P><TT><FONT face="Courier New">ALyymmdd</FONT></TT> Activity logs. These are 
generated by FTL0 and log such information as upload sessions and automatic file 
deletion. 
<P><TT><FONT face="Courier New">BLyymmdd</FONT></TT> Broadcast logs. These are 
also generated by FTL0 and log broadcast information such as number of bytes 
transmitted and number of stations heard. 
<P><TT><FONT face="Courier New">CLyymmdd</FONT></TT> Callsign logs. This logs 
the callsigns heard by the spacecraft each day. 
<P><TT><FONT face="Courier New">ELyymmdd</FONT></TT> Error logs. This is a log 
of the radiation induced errors detected and corrected in the OBC memory. 
<P><TT><FONT face="Courier New">WDmmddnn</FONT></TT> Whole orbit data logs. This 
is stored telemetry sampled throughout the whole orbit. 
<H1>Post Processing of housekeeping data</H1>
<P>The Surrey Mission Operations Centre operated by SSTL currently monitors the 
9 operational UoSAT class microsatellites and is the primary control station for 
6 of these satellites. The control station automatically downloads all 
housekeeping files generated on the spacecraft as well as archiving real time 
telemetry. Once the files are downloaded, they are post processed and archived 
onto optical disk for long term storage. As it isn't easily possible to make all 
this data available full time, post processing is required to reduce the data to 
a manageable size. 
<P>A suite of programs have been developed at SSTL to allow this data set to be 
reduced to a level where it can be stored online and this allows us to view 
trend analyses data to observe the operation of spacecraft systems since launch. 
These programs take the minimum, maximum, average and standard deviation of the 
raw telemetry or WOD surveys, and provide statistical information on other log 
files received from the spacecraft. All data is stored using a common file 
format which ensures extraction and graphing of the data is simple. 
<H2>Example: S80/T OBC Current</H2>
<P>The S80/T spacecraft was launched in 1992 into a 1300km altitude, 66 degree 
inclination orbit. This orbit provides a very harsh radiation environment that 
is approximately six times greater than that for the 800km polar orbit. Over the 
past twelve months it has become apparent that some spacecraft systems are 
starting to show signs of total dose radiation effects. 
<P>The following graph shows the Primary OBC186 current for the past eighteen 
months. From this graph it can be seen that the current is rising rapidly 
following a logarithmic curve. Ultimately this will render the OBC inoperable 
probably due to a failure of the power switch when the current drain reaches 400 
to 500 mA.

<H1>Appendix A: Task functions and status messages</H1>
<H2>FTL0 Task</H2>
<H3>Function</H3>
<P>FTL0 is the primary task involved with uplink and downlink of users 
information. It supports connected mode uplink as well as the broadcast downlink 
protocol. 
<H3>Status Messages</H3>
<P>Message: Open 12a: 
<P>Purpose: The spacecraft will accept uplink requests. The 12 numbers 
correspond to spacecraft the receiver being used by any users, and this is 
generally arranged such that the 1 corresponds to the lowest frequency receiver 
and the 2 to the higher frequency receiver. If there is a user connected to the 
spacecraft then the number corresponding to the receiver being used will be 
replaced by a space, and the callsign of the station will be appended to the 
message.<BR>
<P>Message: FULL 12a: 
<P>Purpose: Same as Open message except the maximum number of users has been 
reached and the spacecraft will not accept further requests. <BR>
<P>Message: SHUT 12a: 
<P>Purpose: The control station has closed the spacecraft for general use. Only 
command stations can connect to the spacecraft when it is shut.<BR>
<P>Message: PB: 
<P>Purpose: The PB message provides a list of stations that are in the broadcast 
queue to download information from the spacecraft. There is a maximum number of 
stations permitted to enter the broadcast queue (generally this is 20 stations). 
Each station will spend a maximum of 5 seconds at the head of the queue. If, 
after the 5 seconds is up, the spacecraft hasn't transmitted all the information 
requested by that station, then the station will return to the end of the queue, 
otherwise it will be removed from the queue.<BR>
<P>Message: B: 
<P>Purpose: This is an incrementing count of the number of bytes of data that 
the spacecraft has transmitted. This is sent by the spacecraft approximately 
every 5 seconds and is used by groundstation software to give an indication of 
groundstation receive efficiency. <BR>

<H2>TST Task</H2>
<H3>Function</H3>
<P>TST is the Transputer Support Task. Generally the transputer is used for 
experiments such as imaging and Global Position System (GPS) and TST provides 
the link between the Transputer and the OBC. 
<H3>Status Messages</H3>
<P>Message: TST: LF=TS960325,C IF=P1SD015B,C TN=7d45 DASH=UP FR=63 HC=5 EC=7 
MR=20,13 
<P><B>LF </B>indicates the file name of most recent TST log file. There is a 
marker [C] to indicate whether the log file is currently open or closed - it 
should typically be closed. 
<P><B>IF</B> shows the file name of the most recent (or currently transferring) 
image file from the transputer. The two letter code identifies a wide angle 
image (IW), a narrow angle image (IN), a star sensor image (SA, SB, SC or SD), 
and the four number code reflect the image number selected when the image was 
captured. UoSAT-5 images all have the 'IM' tag. There is a marker [C] to 
indicate whether this image file is currently open or closed - unless an image 
transfer is in progress, it should typically be closed. 
<P><B>TN</B> gives the operator the number allocated by the ramdisk file system 
for most recent thumb file. This allows the operator to grab the thumb file 
without having to wait for the directory to be up to date. 
<P><B>DASH </B>indicates whether the DASH connection from the OBC to the 
transputer is established (up) or not (down). 
<P><B>FR</B> A message from the transputer scheduler contains one or more DASH 
frames. This entry shows the number of frames received in the most recent 
(possibly currently ongoing) message. A message is considered ongoing until it 
receives the next new message. 
<P><B>HC </B>Shows the most recent HIT command to the TST task. 
<P><B>EC </B>Shows the most recent TDPE scheduler command issued by TST. These 
commands in are: 
<P>capture [EIS] image : 0 
<P>transmit [EIS] image : 4 
<P>set [scheduler] clock : 5 
<P>get [EIS] image status : 6 
<P>get scheduler status : 7 
<P>capture and transmit [EIS] image : 8 
<P>get non-EDAC [memory] status : 9 
<P>wash EDAC memory : 10 
<P>test non-EDAC memory : 11 
<P>adjust [T1] processor speed : 13 
<P>get EDAC memory status : 17 
<P>capture SIS image : 18 
<P>transmit SIS image : 19 
<P>SIS [image] capture and transmit : 20 
<P>get SIS status : 21 
<P><B>MR </B>Similarly, this indicates the most recent message type received 
from the scheduler. The message type number matches the command (see above) that 
instigated the data transfer. Not all commands (e.g. set clock, adjust processor 
speed, capture image, etc.) result in a message returning from the transputer. 
The second parameter is incremented with each new message, which can assist in 
message tracing and debugging.<BR></P></BODY></HTML>
